The volleyball tournament had the playoffs tonight. We ended up losing our first playoff game so in the battle for 3rd place we just had fun, and ended up getting fourth. We had fun, and I still believe that we were the best team out there. Go Brawlers. You were a great captain Jared!
The Romainia people arrive tomorrow!
