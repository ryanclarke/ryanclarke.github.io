It's amazing how much can happen in a year.
 Last year Grandpa Clarke had cancer but was still working (because he liked to chat with people). About a year ago the town of Jamestown founded the Russell S. Clarke Environmental Service Award in his name and honor to be awarded annually. A year ago he was pretty normal, but naturally extraordinary.
 Today is he is dead and buried. All in a year.
 Last year I was almost done with Verity and I had no clue what was next. I didn't even know if I'd be in America or China.
 Today the Lord has clearly lead me to Payson, Arizona and given me a job I love, a house, a car, a housemate, and many other blessings. God has so richly blessed me, in spite of all the hardships this last year. All this in only one year.
 And the questions these thoughts ask would be: What will be happening in a year? What events, thoughts, stories, testimonies, will be the result of this next year? Where will I be in life one year from today?
 And my prayer is: Lord, may I leave a trail pointing towards You. May I leave goodness as much as is in my power. May I be living memorial to Your grace.
 That prayer transcends a solitary year, expanding into a lifetime. So even more significant than this one year, is the question that rings through eternity. What will my legacy be when I follow my grandpa? I don't want to leave a string of impressive events as much as a Godly family. Only then can I stretch the shadow of the cross beyond the future. That is the life of eternity.
