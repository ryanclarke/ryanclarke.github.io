One year ago today:

-   I sat through the first class on how to teach English to Chinese kids.
-   I ventured out on the streets of Pinghu, China for the first time.
-   I traded in hard-earned US dollars for foreign tokens for the first time.
-   I emailed home to say that I was still alive in a Communist country.
-   I was in this picture:
