I had a right fine time at the church picnic. I sat with some folks I've talked with at church both Sundays: Dick and Betty Reese. Mr. Reese just finished up two years on the Town Council. He's a great guy. I think we might become friends. I also met a guy at the picnic who'd been to both Shanghai and Hungzhou (and a lot of other places and countries around the world - loved to travel), so that was neat. I would like to visit large portions of the world too. I talked to Rachel Smith on AIM the other night, and I still sometimes wish I could have gone back to China for a year... But I guess my place is in Payson, AZ right now. Maybe not glamorous, but God has me here. So I'm happy.
By the way, a vicarage is where a vicar lives. One meaning of vicar is a cleric in charge of an Episcopal chapel. Basically like a parson lives at a parsonage. Difference being, the new vicar for our neighboring Episcopal chapel has two large a family for The Vicarage so he'll live elsewhere while Faas and I get to reside in The Vicarage.
