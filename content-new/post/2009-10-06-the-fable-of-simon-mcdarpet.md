I give you the fable of Simon McDarpet,
A boy, it would seem, with a hatred for carpet;
And tables, of course, and most anything wooden
And things that get hurt when you act like you shouldn’t,
And all sorts of rugs, also windows and doors.
But your guess would be right if you singled out floors.
You’d be right on the money—the wad that was spent—
On repairing the issues he could have prevent-
ed because of the sloshing of liquids he did,
All because he refused to seal drinks with a lid.

And don’t get me started on all of the chow
That was strewn down the hall in the wake of that cow.
Steaming heaps of lasagna and well-buttered biscuits,
Potatoes with herbs that were creamed with a wisk—it’s
A shame—and I know of the groans in my belly,
Surveying the wasted baked oatmeal and jelly.
However the groans that were felt in the gut
Of another man spying the path to the mutt
(Like a humanoid snail or a monstrous slug
Who was leaving a trail of wet smears on the rug);
These were groans that could make a man wither in fear
And concurrently make that same man shed a tear,
As poor Curtis would go fetch the tools of his trade,
For the treasure of kingdoms could scarcely have paid
For the hours he spent grimly cleaning the carpet
Of stains that were left by that Simon McDarpet.

I hope you’ll remember, dear cleanliness lover,
To never move food without using a cover.
