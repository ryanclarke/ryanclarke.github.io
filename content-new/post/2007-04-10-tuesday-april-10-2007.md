This is what I looked like today at work.

Some sort of pigment or ink. It was quite obviously black. Faas and I created a fairly dramatic cleanup effort to get the dryer ready for an important customer tomorrow.

PS. Most of it washed off in the shower. Skin is pretty amazing stuff. Good job, God!
