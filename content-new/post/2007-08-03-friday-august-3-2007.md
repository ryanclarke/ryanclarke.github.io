And I'm off!
I'm just putting in a half-day of work today and now I'm headed out to do some crazy adventuring at Lake Powell. My church's youth group was up north at the Navajo Nation all week doing a VBS and now all the retired adult chaperones are tired and don't feel up to the trekking and water sports and paintball, so I'm going up to help out and fill in. That's code for: "I'm going on vacation!" I'll be back on Sunday night.
