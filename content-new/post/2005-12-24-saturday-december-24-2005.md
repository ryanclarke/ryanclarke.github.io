Well, here we are, perched upon the very doorstep of this monument. A monument erected in time, in space, but that spans the centuries and the continents. Even spanning the natural and the supernatural.
 But most of all, bridging the chasm between the divine and the vulgar. The Creator who has no beginning creates Himself as a creation, completely dependant on and inside of another creation. One God in three Persons becomes one God in two Persons and a Person in a Person in a person. We have a divine mystery in this monument.
 The Lamb of God was born in a barn, the same barn which had seen the birth of centuries of lambs slated for sacrifice. The Lamb that stopped the slaughter, born.
 No longer does God set up animals for atonement, He gave His Son; He gave Himself. And no longer does He have a Temple. He demands you and me.
 God becoming man is a unknowable mystery. How can God live in a human body? It is a miracle. But yet, in an even greater way, that is the miraculous reality of the Christian.
 And so we stand on the very doorstep of this monument. And it says, "Choose ye death or life?"
