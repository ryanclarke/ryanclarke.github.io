I don't like Amazon. I think it's because they don't like me. This marks the second time they've immediately frozen my account the minute I gave them my credit card number. Second email, second try in a second year, second failure. And their tech support stinks. I've never bought anything from them, they won't let me.
On a personal note, I'm tired after 12 hours at work.
