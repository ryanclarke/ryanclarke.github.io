Faas and I went to Phoenix today. We went to a neat mall called Desert Ridge. I bought some new sneakers (finally) and Faas bought a book on PivotTables in Excel.
Then when we got home we went to Wal\*Mart. We bought space heaters and food. Yay! for warmth during the winter.
As we were leaving I saw this guy who seemed to be trying to exit the building through the doors they lock at night. I said, "Hey sir, you can get out through the side door over here." He turned around and turned out to be Bill the Night Manager or something important. I apologized, "Didn't know you worked here." He told me I was very helpful and they he liked helpful people and asked if I wanted to work at Wal\*Mart. I took it as a complement and politely turned down his offer. I already have a job that offers me plenty enough hours of work. So now I've been personally offered two jobs: "finance guy" at HQ and "associate" at Wal\*Mart. Instead I'm a "Production Engineer" at PCS, and I love it.
