Home is nice. I'm happy.
 I had one of those 32oz frozen cappuccinos from QuikTrip for \$1.06 the other day. I'm happy.
 I did some unpacking today. I sightread some Mozart Piano Sonatas: not always a high-quality musical event. I did some research on what I should do with my life. I wrestled with Andrew. I did some catching up in my journal. I took a walk with Mom and Lydia and Andrew. I smiled. I'm happy.
