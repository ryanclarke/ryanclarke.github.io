I am shuffling.
 I am busy going through boxes of all my Verity stuff and either finding a place for it in my room, or in another box. So the shuffling is going well, and should have all my stuff well shuffled by tonight. Also, I should have a good idea of what indispensable things I will be taking back up to Verity with me this weekend.
 I was looking through all the notes and letters I got from home and other Verity students while at Verity. There was one very funny letter from my sister Lydia, who is 9 now. It was her penmanship sheet from that day's schooling, nearly a year ago.
Ps. 5:10
 Declare them guilty,
 O GOD! Let their
 intrigues be ther [sic] downfall.
 Banish them for their
 many sins, for they
 have rebelled against
 you.
       Love Lydia
 Anyway, Happy Shuffling! (to me)
 Ryan
