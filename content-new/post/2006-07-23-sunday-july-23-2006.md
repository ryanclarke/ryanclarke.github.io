Nice, easy day off. Today was a very good day.
And the picture was of a chunk of aluminum oxide (often called alumina). It's used to break up chunks of the aluminum powder (used as a centering agent in ceramic) before the aluminum is put in the ceramic liquid. So I am the proud owned of a tiny aluminum oxide marshmallow.
