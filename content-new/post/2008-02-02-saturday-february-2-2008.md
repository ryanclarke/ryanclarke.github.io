I am back at Verity now. I'll be here for a while as guest lecturer and assistant to the curriculum developer. For those who don't know, Verity is now in Indianapolis. So it's odd going back to my school and finding it in an entirely different state. Still this is a nice place and the guys move into the new rooms today. I'm in with the staff guys and we get an entire 5 room suite. That's nice. It should be a good run up here. I still haven't gotten a glimpse of my sister - she was at the symphony till late last night.
