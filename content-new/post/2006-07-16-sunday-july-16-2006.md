I like meeting old folks. You never know what stories they are going to have, but they're bound to be interesting. Faas and I met up with a bunch of old folks from church at Tiny's Family Restaurant. I ended up talking with a lady who made a career on the stage. She did the lead comic female of a whole string of stage musical productions including South Pacific and Carousel. Then she went into commercials, and worked for a local Ford mega-dealer for 8 and a half year playing the the dealer's mother for the TV spots. The commercials were so funny and popular that she became a local celebrity, complete with TV interviews and full-size cardboard silhouettes. Some fun stories.
I hope I'm a fun-story-guy when I get old.
