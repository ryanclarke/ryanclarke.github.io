I figured I might have a fever. So I looked around for the thermometer, and couldn't find it. Then my sisters found the one that doesn't work, so I figured I'd try it anyway. I read me at 102.6° four times in a row. Then it read Mom at 94.5° so I'm not sure how accurate it is. Today it had me pegged at 100.3° so maybe I'm improving.
 I finally felt bad enough to actually ask for The Machine. The Machine is a curved piece of PVC pipe set over a small bowl. The victim then drapes a pillowcase over their head and inhales. You see, the bowl is boiling water with a small lump of Vick's VapoRub in it. And it steams. So basically, I'm breathing greasy air. I hate it, but Mom says it works and I'm desperate.
 And I'm drinking unsweetened tea.
