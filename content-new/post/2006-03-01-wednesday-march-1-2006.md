Full surrender to Christ: easy to say, hard to do. Maybe it's because I view surrender as an event, not an active lifestyle. Also, I want God's will, but I want His will to be what I want it to be. And I'm not even sure what I want it to be always. So I try to reach the place where I desire for only His perfect will to be done in my life. Even if it's not what I may want. That is where surrender meets sacrifice.
