I am leaving tomorrow morning, early, for New England. I'll be in there with my family and extended family for over a week. I think we're coming back home on the next Sunday, the 10th. It should be a lot of fun. Unfortunately, I probably won't have access to internet on this trip, so I'll have to update when I get back. We'll see. If you really need to get ahold of me, call the cellphone I'm borrowing from my sister, if you know the number, because I'm not posting it on the web. Unless I know that you have Verizon, I'll ignore your call and get back with you on the weekend or after 9pm, whichever comes first (the correct answer is 9pm). But please don't let that discourage you: please call!
 I may get to go sailing.
 Ryan
