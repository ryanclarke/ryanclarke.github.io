"Look at The Scar!"
It's the GRAND CANYON and it's Big.
I know. I went there on Saturday.

Faas and I drove the 190 miles there (and then back) to stand on the rim and be amazed.

This is one of the many official overlooks.

This overlook was a little better in my opinion.

It was more personal.

It was pretty much everything that everyone says it would be. Personally, it was so huge it seemed a little fake. I guess I just can't imagine anything really being that vast.
So I guess it's not a scar on our national landscape. I like it there. And if you asked all the Asian tourists, I think they'd agree.
