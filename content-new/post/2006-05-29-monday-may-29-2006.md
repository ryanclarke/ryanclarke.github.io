The 2006 Verity graduation was great. I have so many friends in the '06 class, and many others from the '05 class that were also there. Seeing all those '06 people finish Verity just like I did a year ago was very neat. I pray that they will all experience God's blessing in the next stage of their life.
I don't really have any time right now. I just woke up and I still need to unpack from the Flint trip and pack for the Nashville conference. We leave in about an hour. I might a see a few of you there.
To the Verity class of 2006, "Congratulations!"
Ryan
