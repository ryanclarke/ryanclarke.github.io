JRod and I just got back from the wedding. It was really nice. Yesterday we drove down to Niles, MI for the rehearsal. Then we were able to get in touch with Arlan, and we went over and crashed at his house. It was a lot of fun. we went out and played some tennis and then went to the local coffee shop. In the morning we left fairly early and went back to Niles for the wedding. Very nice service: totally Christ-centered. Then after the reception where they served this really good coffee punch, we drove back to Flint. It's about a 3.5 hour drive. So we're back, somewhat tired, but happy.
