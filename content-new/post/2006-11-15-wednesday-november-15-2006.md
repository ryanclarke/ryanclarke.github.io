Faas and I were singing The Ten Unchangables Song tonight. We feel sorry for the people we know who have to deal with number 5 on a daily basis.
We have these two genius customers in for the rest of the week. They are inventors. We're drying the sugar like stuff for them, except that it very healthy and is way sweeter. You just lick the air and it tastes like candy. I love my job! They love our operations so much that they're planning on moving to Payson so they can invent stuff faster. Like candy, I hope.
By the way, I bet you all sang the song.
Ryan
