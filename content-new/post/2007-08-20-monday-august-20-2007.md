I'm really tired tonight. It must have been my amazingly full weekend: parade, rodeo, teaching teen Sunday school, paintball, evangelism training, etc.
I better go to bed early before I lose it. I am prone to trust Christ less when I'm tired; and without Christ, things of life are very dismal indeed. Although with Christ, life can be joy and peace in the midst of any circumstances. So with that, I head to bed.
God is too good to me.
