I choose the One that chose me from the first.
I give to Him the life He's given me.
He blessed me as His child while at my worst.
I in Him and He to live in me.
I just wrote a long post about sin, repentance, forgiveness, and victory. But I'm going to substitute a shorter one. If I'm honest to myself, I sin actual sins, sins that I hate but that I can't seem to stop. Paul struggled with the same thing in Romans 7. God, who chose me, isn't going to abandon me. Keep fighting. The struggle against sin is worth it. Just endure. I know that through Christ I am a conqueror. I pray and fight for the day when I leave sins farther behind to become more of the man I should be. Remembering: the fact that I hate sin is a good thing, and a sign that Christ is at work in me.
1 John 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
