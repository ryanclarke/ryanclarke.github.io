Played tennis again tonight. I'm getting a lot better. Relative to awful. We went a little earlier so we could actually see the ball, which is nice. Faas 7, Ryan 3. It's great to get outside, run around, and athleticize.
On a personal note, yesterday I tied my shoes while stooping on a speed bump. It was my first time to do that. I only realized what I'd done after I did it. If this gives you any ideas, remember: be safe.
So this fun, restful weekend is over, and I'm ready to tackle another week of work. Praise the Lord for strength and provision! Also for recharge and recovery!
Ryan
