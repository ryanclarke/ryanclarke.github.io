I think that I finally realized why it's happening to me - I haven't been forwarding all those heartwarming emails thatÂ  end with curses. So these are my three days of bad luck. And to think I thought those foreboding warnings
were fraudulent... But they came crashing back, like a jagged but curiously accurate boomerang, at long last.
I, Ryan, being of rapidly deteriorating endurance, and likewise he, J.S. Faas, of mechanical and desperately coping nature, and furthermore they, Other Coworkers, of unknown and probably unstable composition, completed drying all the rosemary today, at long last. \<insert breath here, at long last\> And there was much rejoicing. Whoop whoop.
Weekend. At long last.
Ryan
