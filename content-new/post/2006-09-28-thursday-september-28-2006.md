So I unstacked over 2 tons of boxes off their pallets and put them in other stacks on the floor. Then I restacked the more than 2 tons of boxes back on the pallets. I hope the Rosemary people are happy now. In the process I managed to kill a black widow spider. I was actually feeling pretty pleased with myself. Not often do I see black widows, or get the chance to create their demise.
What timing. No sooner had I wiped the remains of the deed of the box than the pest control guy came. Not the one who looks like a 35 year-old AmooseA with a geeky little mustache - the other one who looks like a soft-drink development tester, just before they get the new formula right.
The gist of my statement:
       "I just compressed a black widow fatally between these heavy boxes of healing herbs."
Bug guy (understandingly and consolingly, with Arkansas drawl):
       "Well they won't hurt ya none. They jests stings like [purgatory] and then ya feel sick to throwup or die for a few days. And then your all fine and they won't hurt ya none."
Thanks, that was a great comfort to me. Can I have a developmental soft-drink or are they all 8-Up? Too bad.
