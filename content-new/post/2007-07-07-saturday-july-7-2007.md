I feel excited because of my wound. But I'm not especially excited. Whenever I get really excited in an anticipatory way my lower gums get tingly and numb. And this sore on the inside of my lower lip is making my gums tingly and numb. So I keep wondering why I feel so vaguely excited...
I went to the coffeeshop and read for a while. 'Twas a good time: I hadn't been in a while. And there was a guy trying to sing old-timey country, so that makes the experience even more colorful.
On a personal note, "The Lord of the Shoehorn" sounds like a good title.
"Enveloped in smoke and the burning of flames,
And the tumult of voices without any names,
Sitting high on a throne of white, porcelain mold
Reins the Lord of the Shoehorn, by whom men are soled.
And the traveler's feet have been fated to stay
Weakly barefoot and feeble 'til booted away."
