And so, I finished my first year of work. I should have been a happy day as not only was it a big milestone but I was covered in sugar almost the entire afternoon. But for some reason I had one of my lowest days in months. I was overwhelmed with a sense of futility (I hate it when that happens). Mom says it's good though, because it proves that I'm real. Haha, I had to laugh. I guess I am happy almost all the time, and I don't let bad situations steal my joy. But occasionally that little unrest in my soul that pushes me to dream bigger things breaks loose and points a haughty finger at the pleasant niche I've carved alone here in Arizona. And I wish for more.
I feel better now because I'm realizing I've done more this last year than go to work 244 days. I've learned, I've matured, and I've proven myself, in some small way, to myself. Maybe I'm closer to the goal.
On a personal note: I saw myself in the mirror this morning. Again.
Ryan
