Yes, I passed my test. I got 95% and passing was about 93%. So, I came closest to failing one of Dr. Kincaid's courses on one of my highest scores. I am very happy that I passed. I talked to Dr. K. after the test and was very confident in my ability to teach Principles of Harmony 1 & 2. That is a very encouraging thing to know. So classes start sometime next January!
