*"Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace."* James 3:13, 17-18
 I would that that was describing me. I want wisdom.
 *"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord."* James 1:5-7
 Just ask. In faith. And recieve. Liberally.
 I want wisdom because I am obviously not wise. I want wisdom because I want *"the fruit of righteousness [to be] sown in peace"* in my life.
