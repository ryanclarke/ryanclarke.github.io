Today was a good day at work. The president of the company really likes what I'm doing on the website redesign. That's a very good thing.Â  So I'll keep pressing ahead. It's a big job, but I have several weeks to do it. And finally, at the end of the day, we made some good corn steep liquor powder.
Quotes of the day by Faas:
"Look, those guys are raking again."
Later: "I wonder what he's doing. Probably job interviews or something."
Okay, so maybe the quotes from today weren't that great. But they are kind of funny together.
