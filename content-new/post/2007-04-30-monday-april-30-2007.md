This is now:
How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? Consider *and* hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
This is my hope:
I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
\~from Psalm 13

5:28pm EDIT:
 Okay, I'm singing again because I'm starting to remember God's bounty. It's amazing how quickly I forget God's goodness and things seem rough and desperate. But then I trust God and things are rough and hopeful.
I believe that what He said He will do. Now I just have the little problem of "What did He say?" So, back to the Bible and prayer. The Word informs our prayers, and our prayers employ the Word.
