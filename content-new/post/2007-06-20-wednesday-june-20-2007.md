Last night was sushi. Surprisingly, I sort of liked some of it.
Here's a view of the 'skyline' of the exit we're on off of Canadian Highway 1.

Tonight we had Chinese. Delicious. Here's a view of Mount Baker in Washington taken from CA Hwy 1 on the way back from dinner.

We're doing a lot of work (and it's going pretty well), but we have had some time to make it fun.
