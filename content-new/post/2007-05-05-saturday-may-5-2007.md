Thirteen hours non-stop. I guess God knew I could do it, because I didn't think so. And "It's over!!!" Off to do a bunch of productive things with my weekend, starting with sleep.
Question: Can passive, unquestioning trust in God's faithfulness and goodness on our behalf be corrupted into callous indifference and careless apathy?
