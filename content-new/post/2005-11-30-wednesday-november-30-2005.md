It's my Mom's birthday today. I will say right now that she is the best Mom I could have had. Dad was flying, so we're not really going to celebrate until he get's home. But I just wanted to acknowledge the day, and honor her for her incredible investment in my life. She is the self-styled president of my fan club.
 And miscellaneous other things happened today.
 Today marks the first time that I put gas in a vehicle while I was out in it alone. I know, I know. But I have been at Verity for about 80% of the time I've had a licence. I asked the guy to whom I prepaid inside: "I'm new at this. Does it turn off when I've used all my money I gave you?" He was so nice, "Of course, sir" in his Indian accent. And behold, it did. The marvels of technology.
