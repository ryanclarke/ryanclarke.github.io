Words from Faas today.
"... my new haircut make me look faster."
I think you should put a picture on the announcements page of the Payson Roundup. "Look who has a new, fast haircut! ::picture::"
On a personal note, we opened up our windows today. We let the seasonal autumn air discharge the spent summer oxygen.
