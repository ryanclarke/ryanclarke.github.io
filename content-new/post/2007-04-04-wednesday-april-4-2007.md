"How? How?" you ask. Actually, The Stuff (from yesterday's post) doesn't smell like urine in large quantities. Lots of it together smells more like rotten eggs. It's semantics really, just exchanging one pleasantry for another. The stuff dried like a total charm, so I wouldn't dream of complaining.
AND NOW ... FOR OUR FEATURE PRESENTATION ...
I'm off to see the wizard, wonderful wizard of Faas.Â  I'm going to the airport to retrieve him. Yippee! And there was much rejoicing.
