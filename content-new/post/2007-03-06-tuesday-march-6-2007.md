I played some hymns on my violin. Great is Thy Faithfulness has always been a favorite. I was almost brought to tears - by my atrocious (lack of) intonation.
Check out John 6:67-69. Those are some powerful verses. On a slight tangent, you read the words 'word', 'light', 'sent', and 'truth' a lot in John.
