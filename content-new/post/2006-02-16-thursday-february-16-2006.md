Teaching was long today. I graded over 60 assignments today. And I saw each one an average of 2 or 3 times to re-grade the corrections. That is a lot of harmony to think. It's also hard on the students, because this is the first time that they are thinking these thoughts, whereas I've been thought them many thousands of times in the last few years.
A nice group took me out for dinner tonight. At Red Robin! It was a lot of fun. And I even got the free song and ice cream. It was a good night.
