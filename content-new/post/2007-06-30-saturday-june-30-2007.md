Celebration. My xanga has now reached 1,000 days old. Yes, I have been actively blogging a public record of my life, adventures, thoughts, challenges, status, and idiosyncrasies for an entire kiloday. I would like to thank my parents for making this milestone possible and [Amy](http://www.xanga.com/Californeean) for making it necessary.
I want to say thank you to all you people who actually read this thing, even if only occasionally. If it wasn't for you, this would just be a diary.
Ryan
P.S. In the off-chance that you were wondering what's happening in my life these last few days: nothing web-worthy. I'll notify you if anything bizarre happens.
