It's been one of those days. Just a little bit of everything thrown together. It started hesitantly. We'll see if it ends gloriously with my team winning our volleyball matches: especially the first one. Go team!
Also, I just finished all the requirements for two TESC portfolios! At least, I hope. I should hear back from them soon. This will put me to 119 credits.
