Well, I am finally posting a few pictures of my time in China. So, here they are.
 First, another view of me at the Tea House.

 Second, since this was a teaching trip, I may as well show that I did some teaching. Here is a picture of me hanging out with some kids on the first week.

 And here is a picture of me when I went out with my teaching assistant from the second week, Rachel. I unfortunately have been unable to the pictures of my first TA Steven off my camera. Here is Rachel and me on a rock in Pinghu one afternoon when we went out around the town. This is just after she got my card back for me from the bank after the ATM stole it.
