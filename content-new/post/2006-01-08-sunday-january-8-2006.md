I'm sick. Or something very similar.
 I watched Oklahoma last night, which is a perfectly stupid movie. I doubt I'll ever waste any time on it in the future. I disliked every character. And their actions.
 I went down with a headache and a cough and woke up and 4:40am with a headache and a cough and a sore back/neck. Then I woke up at 10:30am with a headache and cough and sore back/neck. So I missed church. But Mom wasn't feeling so well either and we talked for a long time. We both still feel pretty less than perfect. And my logic part isn't working so well right now. I'm slightly confused. I also fluctuate between hot and cold, but my internal temperature is not wrong.
 It reminds me of the Thursday night at The Wilds when this girl I met there was getting signatures in her book and asked me to write a little note with her gel pen. It was 12:30am late. This is what I wrote:
Erim, (oops)
 Thank you for we knowing us each
 one here. You know what I mean.

 So, yeah. Maybe I'll be feeling better tomorrow.
