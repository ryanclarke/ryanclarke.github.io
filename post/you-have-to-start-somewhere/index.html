<p>I started fresh in at SEP on Monday and by Tuesday the bananas were fresh out.</p>

<p>Fellow new guy Jackson and I were tasked with our first project on Monday just before quittin&rsquo; time: update the internal résumé reporting website from &lsquo;ancient&rsquo; to &lsquo;tomorrow.&rsquo; It currently runs on a mid-2006 vintage copy of Ruby on Rails (version 1.1.6). We&rsquo;re supposed to be bringing it up to Rails 4 (coming soon, 2013) but some fundamental pieces of its inner-working were axed from Rails by the end of 2006. We&rsquo;re not supposed to rewrite the project, just bring it up to date, but many important pieces cannot be upgraded.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I&rsquo;m fresh in when it comes to Rails (&ldquo;never touched the stuff&rdquo;), so by Tuesday afternoon my brains were fresh out. And, as I said before, so were the bananas.</p>

<p>As we passed through The Commons during the first-day tour, Laura from HR said &ldquo;there shall be fruit&rdquo; and, unfortunately, there was no fruit. In my hour of need: fresh out. To quote the great Barney Fife, &ldquo;Well, Andy, a slender high-spirited person needs a sugar pick-me-up late in the day.&rdquo; I had to settle for a cup of ice. Just then, something happened…</p>

<h5 id="toc_0">Chapter 2</h5>

<p><em>Just when hope is almost lost, things start to look brighter for our young heroes.</em></p>

<p>A remarkable thing about SEP: everyone is willing to help. Not to be too self-critical (and Jackson&rsquo;s effort, to be fair, was nothing short of heroic), but we needed help.
There are many things I don&rsquo;t know. Rails is not the only thing on that list. Here are a few others to get you started. I don&rsquo;t know:</p>

<ul>
<li>The name of the git server (easy to guess)</li>
<li>The name of the TFS server (impossible to guess, sounds more like a band name)</li>
<li>The name of the database server (easy, but after the TFS server I was expecting anything)</li>
<li>The name of the project (five-digit number starting with 06)</li>
<li>The name of the guy in the next cube (I love the three-monitor setup)</li>
</ul>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t know about many company policies. For instance, do lowly developers need an official sanction from IT to brazenly install Ubuntu VMs on our machines (no). And I haven&rsquo;t even started on all the questions we had about the résumé website&rsquo;s architecture and history.</p>

<h5 id="toc_1">Chapter 3</h5>

<p><em>Sorry about chapter 2, this is where things actually get better.</em></p>

<p>Matt Swanson. He has worked on the résumé system. We asked him a lot of dumb questions and he gave us a lot of good answers. He helped us a ton and he&rsquo;s given the project a fresh start.</p>

<p>I would like to give a You Rock™ card to Matt (like they told us about in orientation), but I don&rsquo;t know where they are.</p>

<p>P.S. For non-SEPeers: if you are given two You Rock™ cards of the same color or one each of both colors, you can turn them in to receive Good Stuff™.</p>
