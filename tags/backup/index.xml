      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.ryanclarke.net/images/Win8CPStartScreen.png&#34; alt=&#34;Windows 8 Consumer Preview start screen&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there I was&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d &amp;ldquo;known&amp;rdquo; that the Windows 8 Consumer Preview was coming out in February since //build/ in September. I&amp;rsquo;d known it was going to be on the &amp;ldquo;congratulations for surviving 4 more years, here&amp;rsquo;s 24 bonus hours&amp;rdquo; day since early in the month. I&amp;rsquo;d known that the download would be finished by quitting time since I started it that morning (it&amp;rsquo;s a slow hose).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I popped the install disk into my little old laptop-a sacrificial gesture so that any weird issues wouldn&amp;rsquo;t effect my main battletower-and would you know it: I&amp;rsquo;d done it again. On this First day of March in the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand Twelve, Windows 8 Consumer Preview dawned for me. The laptop did not spend quality time with me last evening: it communed instead with the Personal Backup Solution™. For the third Windows release in a row, I have completely forgotten to backup my marked-for-destruction hard drive until the cheeky little installer asked what partition I&amp;rsquo;d like to feed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moral: It should have been April 1 today. And Windows 9 will probably get me too.&lt;/p&gt;
