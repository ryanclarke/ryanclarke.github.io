      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow Ben and I leave. Ben goes home and I go the Verity graduation. Long weekend here I come!
This last week has been a blast with Ben here. I worked long days so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much time with him, but it was still fun.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So my family left this morning. Except Ben who&amp;rsquo;s staying through Thursday.
We watched a rodeo parade, saw a cowboy action shoot, went to the aero fair, the rodeo, and church, watched Bringing Up Baby, and generally had a great time this weekend. I love my family.
No pictures, sorry. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xanga.com/sarahdipityinlime&#34;&gt;Sarah&amp;rsquo;s xanga&lt;/a&gt; to see some of the family&amp;rsquo;s trip photos.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My Mom&amp;rsquo;s Number One!
I&amp;rsquo;ll be seeing her (and the rest of the family) next weekend when they come out here, so we&amp;rsquo;ll do the special celebratory things then. But I just had to join the bragging festival today. Sorry everyone: my Mom wins.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking to my brother Ben on the phone today. I love him, I mean, he&amp;rsquo;s my brother after all. But I&amp;rsquo;m proud of him too. With my parents I definitely love them. But I think with my siblings pride trumps love. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s part of being the oldest.
Ben can play circles around anyone on a clarinet.
And he can certainly outdo me on the piano.
He sings better.
He can light me up in paintball.
He&amp;rsquo;s better with animals.
He can be with people who are acting totally foolish and not lose his composure.
He&amp;rsquo;s stronger.
I think I&amp;rsquo;m still faster though.
And I always could make a better bow and arrow.
Be he was a better archer.
He can fix an engine.
He can build a house. I&amp;rsquo;m sure.
But I was a better Legos builder.
He can run an entire week-long day-camp for inner-city Atlanta gang kids all summer.
He is the best foosball player I know.
He can pass advanced calculus his first semester at college, and he was the one who hated math.
He&amp;rsquo;s a hard worker.
And no, it&amp;rsquo;s not his birthday. I just felt like telling the world, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s my brother.&amp;rdquo;
By the way, my sister Sarah had a violin solo at some big concert tonight. Wish I could have been there.
