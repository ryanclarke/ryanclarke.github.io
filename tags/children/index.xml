&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much talk and controversy in the tech world surrounding Windows 8. One consistant charge is that it might be fine for a tablet, but nobody wants a a touch screen for a &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; work computer like a laptop or desktop. I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Sinofsky, President of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Windows Division, mentioned it a talk how strange it is that we have come to expect touch screens on every electronic device except the most expensive and powerful one we have. Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t laptops and desktops have touch screens too? Even babies think laptops should have touch screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power user types like to say that keyboard and mouse is better, but how can simply lacking touch be better? Keyboard, mouse AND touch seems like a clear improvement. More options. In fact, as a power user myself, I try to avoid the mouse all the time in favor of the keyboard but there are times when you need a pointing device. I would much rather just use my finger than having to fiddle with a mouse for those brief interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day I will have a multiple touch screen desktop, and every screen will be a touch screen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the other side of childhood&lt;br /&gt;
When youth’s young bud has grown&lt;br /&gt;
And some flowers it has bloomed produce&lt;br /&gt;
A sprout to call their own,&lt;br /&gt;
May the length of ages not induce&lt;br /&gt;
What often it has wrought&lt;br /&gt;
In accum&amp;rsquo;lative forgetfulness&lt;br /&gt;
And stiffening of thought:&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t ignore the lofty joy and stress&lt;br /&gt;
A juvenile knows,&lt;br /&gt;
But with lavish love fulfill the needs—&lt;br /&gt;
Like rain upon the flower seeds—&lt;br /&gt;
Required by each that grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of childhood&lt;br /&gt;
Recall where once you stood.&lt;/p&gt;
