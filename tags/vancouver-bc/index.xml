      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty tired. I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I have only one more day in Canada. This week has been crazy. Fun, but crazy, and it&amp;rsquo;s wearing me out. Also, the hotel is not the same as being home.
I tell you: it really can rain here.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it was a long day of work. And I need to get a few minutes sleep before we head back to the plant. Yes, we have a few things to do at work at midnight.
Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m going to the Baptist church around the corner. So it&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to drop the work for a little while and do some worship.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went for a walk today through the neighborhood here. They have little walkways among the houses and and ravines in the area. So I took pictures. Here&amp;rsquo;s a nifty tree house that I found.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/3e1dc130323960/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://x3e.xanga.com/1dcd465356531130323960/b94904280.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Treehouse&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 Tonight was 10-year-old girls softball night. I saw 5 different games (10 teams) at two different schools in 1 hour. It was the handy paths that allowed me to cover ground and see so much. And they even have bridges over the ravines to make the walk more fun (ie. easy).
 &lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/a9164130324013/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://xa9.xanga.com/16480a0304c39130324013/b94904325.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;RavineBridge&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Then I finished the walk with a stop into the Wired Monk coffee bistro for a little drink. Pleasant little neighborhood. Except that no one responds to my cheery &amp;ldquo;hi!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;good evening!&amp;rdquo; as I pass them on the trail.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was sushi. Surprisingly, I sort of liked some of it.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a view of the &amp;lsquo;skyline&amp;rsquo; of the exit we&amp;rsquo;re on off of Canadian Highway 1.
 &lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/d26f2129992430/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://xd2.xanga.com/6f2d96e264432129992430/b94630669.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;ExitSkyline&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Tonight we had Chinese. Delicious. Here&amp;rsquo;s a view of Mount Baker in Washington taken from CA Hwy 1 on the way back from dinner.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/29177129992488/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://x29.xanga.com/177c001071c34129992488/b94630717.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;MtBaker&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;re doing a lot of work (and it&amp;rsquo;s going pretty well), but we have had some time to make it fun.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a crazy-busy-fun weekend. And I head up to Vancouver, BC tomorrow for just over a week of work. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m going on an international business trip: go me.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to Canada before.
