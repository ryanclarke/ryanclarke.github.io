      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made it back to Georgia about 24 hours ago. Sarah and I left Arizona a week ago Thursday and 2001 miles, 7 days, and 11 states later we made it home. Of course, you may be thinking that a week is a long time for such a drive and you&amp;rsquo;re right. We stopped for a day in Kansas for Mama Shoe&amp;rsquo;s memorial service and two days in Kentucky visiting the Reckner&amp;rsquo;s. So it was a leisurely trip. The last day was the most eventful. We were hardly 5 miles from the Reckner&amp;rsquo;s when the rear passenger tire totally disintegrated. We had to unload the entire trunk to get the jack and the spare out and that when I discovered that the included jack was totally useless for changing the rear tire. Fortunately Mr. Reckner had a bottle jack and was able to help me get changed to limp into town and get a new tire. It took a while so we didn&amp;rsquo;t head for home until mid-afternoon. But we&amp;rsquo;re back and it&amp;rsquo;s great to be with family again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the next step, whatever it is. All this has kept me crushingly busy so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably take a short breather and then start pursuing my future again with anticipation. There are these little dreams we all have, and maybe some of mine will start to come true. By &amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo; dreams, I mean those impossibly magnificient ideas that we harbor so close to our soul until they become a living part of us. Life isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy, but it&amp;rsquo;s terribly exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The wedding was amazing. I have spent the last few days at home and now we&amp;rsquo;re all headed up to North Carolina for Thanksgiving. Here&amp;rsquo;s wishing you all a happy Thanksgiving and a grateful heart.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m headed east! I&amp;rsquo;m spending a day at Verity before heading down to my good friend Bryce&amp;rsquo;s wedding where I&amp;rsquo;ll be the best man. Then I spend the whole following week and Thanksgiving with my family. This is going to be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Pastor Allen gave me a gift certificate to the Phoenix Symphony in appreciation for me filling in for him these last two weeks. I was quite surprised on top of happy. Of all the perfect gifts! So, now I just have to decide what I want to see&amp;hellip; and who to bring with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just a few hours I head to the church to begin my long weekend with the youth. We drive through the night, spend Saturday at Magic Mountain riding coasters, Sunday morning at the beach freezing in the water, and then we drive and get back Sunday night. It&amp;rsquo;s 8 hours to Santa Barbara. And 8 hours back.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lost in the Superstition Mountains, Part 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I promised &lt;a href=&#34;//www.ryanclarke.net/journal/lost-in-the-superstition-mountains&#34;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;, here are pictures from my adventure in the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went with some guys from church four-wheeling. We ended up getting lost and having to spend an extra day in the wild. I don&amp;rsquo;t have very many pictures yet, but here are a few. Here I am standing at the top of a hill we drove the trucks down. It was more like a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.ryanclarke.net/images/journal/like-abraham.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Like Abraham&#34; title=&#34;Like Abraham&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a sample of the roads we drove on. One truck got so stuck that we had to leave it. We took everything valuable, like a carburetor, out of it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//www.ryanclarke.net/images/journal/mountain-road.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mountain road&#34; title=&#34;Mountain Road&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll have better shots of the epic soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went out with some friends from church on Sunday and Monday. We went off-roading into the mountains east of Phoenix and camped the night. It was a rugged adventure. Unfortunately, the story doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense without images and my camera was one of the first things the wilderness claimed. Two other guys had cameras and took pictures and videos of most of the whole thing. So when I get a hold of some evidence, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell my once-in-a-lifetime (I hope!) tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, travel in pairs - or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&#34;//www.ryanclarke.net/journal/lost-in-the-superstition-mountains-part-2&#34;&gt;pictures here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We made it. I am back. I will say one thing about Arizona&amp;rsquo;s countryside: it&amp;rsquo;s very unforgiving.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The wedding was great. In fact, the entire weekend was a blast. I&amp;rsquo;ll post more later.

P.S. This post was mostly for Mom&amp;rsquo;s benefit so she can know that I got home safely.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The wedding was very lovely, although not in the usual sense. It was clean. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t all the crazy fluff and froo-froo that normally accompanies weddings. Just 15 hymns, 2 sermons, and some heartfelt vows. Then we went to the reception. The grove (which I mentioned before) we all decked out with glowing orbs hanging from the trees and tiki lanterns around the pond and reflecting off the water. Beneath were table and chairs for eating the delicious treats they had laid out. Heather was there, and so I show you the only picture I had taken during the entire party. Amy, Josh, me, and Heather.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/d9378141588072/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://xd9.xanga.com/378d9b2b75d30141588072/b104456194.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Strickler Wedding&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Also, Luke Johnson was there but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a picture. And so we eventually saw the new couple off for their adventure in Boston. And we returned to the house to throw the leftover candies in the air and try to catch them in our mouths. I cannot hold a candle to the Strickler family in that skill area.
On Sunday morning we went to church. The worship service style was very old fashioned as was the music also. It was really neat to get to participate. The have an extensive sharing and testimonial time during the first hours of the service and I exercised great self-control and did not stand up and blab. Then they asked if any visitors would like to share, so I acquiesced. I read Ephesians 4:3-6. Afterwards during the succulent potluck many folks thanked me for sharing. I guess giving testimonials is highly regarded and encouraged, so they were very happy that a guest joined in. I was just moved to partake of the rich spiritual unity among such different traditional customs. They had a lot of dessert.
Flying out I sat next to an Israeli guy who makes processors for Nikon cameras. He&amp;rsquo;s doing four months of job training her in Phoenix. He was reading a Russian book (that, interestingly, had a Japanese guy on the front).
In Phoenix I was able to get right into my car, which was a great relief, because going out there I had left my keys in the ignition. But I had the shuttle bus guy drive me back to the lot and the car was unlocked and I got my keys and all. So I had no trouble coming home. What a dumb stunt that was though.
The Strickler family is one of the most hospitable families I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met. The entire trip was a blast. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I went and it was good to see Josh get all happily married off.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a little slower around here now. Everyone of importance is out taking pictures. Or rather, having pictures of themselves taken.
I am thoroughly enjoying having a blast here. I&amp;rsquo;m staying with the Stricklers and it is definitely the place to be. The whole family is fun and energetic. Yesterday and this morning we spent a lot of time getting the Strickler&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;backyard&amp;rdquo; ready for the reception. It&amp;rsquo;s in the &amp;lsquo;grove&amp;rsquo; next to the pond. I put grove within marks because it&amp;rsquo;s unlike a normal grove. Their grandfather loved trees so he planted over 300 different types of trees around the farm (some of which has since been sold off to make a highway). The grove has about 30 huge trees of several varieties including a redwood and the back side of the pond has about 40 more types. The evergreen windbreak in front of the house is equally varied. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a really neat look. So the reception is ready. Also, Josh and I got his new radio wired into his car. So it looks like everything is in order for the wedding this evening at the church and then the reception afterward.
I wish more of you Verity friends of Josh could have come, you&amp;rsquo;d be having a blast too.
