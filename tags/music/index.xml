      <description>&lt;p&gt;We made enough money at the church yard sale to send all the youth students on the retreat to California! It was quite a success, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty tired now. Okay, very tired. Filling in for Pastor Allen is not an easy job. And tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m teaching Sunday School for him too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also tomorrow I plan to swing by the 37th Annual Old-Time Fiddlers Contest. How could I miss something like that? It&amp;rsquo;s a busy weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night after work I went over to my coworker Joseph&amp;rsquo;s house and we ate pizza and watched Robots. Laughed our heads off. &amp;ldquo;Good luck with your dastardly plans.&amp;rdquo;
I also got a tax document in the mail saying I miscalculated my AZ tax return. They owe me \$203 dollars more than I thought. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how in the world I got that wrong. At least I was off in the right direction. Thank you, God, for the unexpected little boost! Because&amp;hellip;
Today the rent is due. Again. With all the regularity of those dashed lines on the road. And Cheese-its, which are always gone the day after you open the box.
On a slightly different note. It&amp;rsquo;s always fun it introduce myself to someone while I&amp;rsquo;m wearing my work uniform that has a name patch. &amp;ldquo;Hello, my name is&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; well, yesterday&amp;hellip; just a second&amp;hellip; *checks name patch*&amp;hellip; Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Ryan.&amp;rdquo;
I joined the choir. And everyone is still coming to church.
