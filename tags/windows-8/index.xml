&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much talk and controversy in the tech world surrounding Windows 8. One consistant charge is that it might be fine for a tablet, but nobody wants a a touch screen for a &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; work computer like a laptop or desktop. I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven Sinofsky, President of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Windows Division, mentioned it a talk how strange it is that we have come to expect touch screens on every electronic device except the most expensive and powerful one we have. Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t laptops and desktops have touch screens too? Even babies think laptops should have touch screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power user types like to say that keyboard and mouse is better, but how can simply lacking touch be better? Keyboard, mouse AND touch seems like a clear improvement. More options. In fact, as a power user myself, I try to avoid the mouse all the time in favor of the keyboard but there are times when you need a pointing device. I would much rather just use my finger than having to fiddle with a mouse for those brief interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day I will have a multiple touch screen desktop, and every screen will be a touch screen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>March 1st is Windows 8 day!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/Win8CPStartScreen.png&#34; alt=&#34;Windows 8 Consumer Preview start screen&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there I was&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d &amp;ldquo;known&amp;rdquo; that the Windows 8 Consumer Preview was coming out in February since //build/ in September. I&amp;rsquo;d known it was going to be on the &amp;ldquo;congratulations for surviving 4 more years, here&amp;rsquo;s 24 bonus hours&amp;rdquo; day since early in the month. I&amp;rsquo;d known that the download would be finished by quitting time since I started it that morning (it&amp;rsquo;s a slow hose).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I popped the install disk into my little old laptop-a sacrificial gesture so that any weird issues wouldn&amp;rsquo;t effect my main battletower-and would you know it: I&amp;rsquo;d done it again. On this First day of March in the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand Twelve, Windows 8 Consumer Preview dawned for me. The laptop did not spend quality time with me last evening: it communed instead with the Personal Backup Solution™. For the third Windows release in a row, I have completely forgotten to backup my marked-for-destruction hard drive until the cheeky little installer asked what partition I&amp;rsquo;d like to feed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moral: It should have been April 1 today. And Windows 9 will probably get me too.&lt;/p&gt;
