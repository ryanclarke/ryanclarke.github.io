&lt;h3 id=&#34;advice-on-your-20th-birthday-from-the-perspective-of-28-years&#34;&gt;Advice on Your 20th Birthday from the Perspective of 28 Years&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Friend,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decade which you now commence is fraught with adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 20, I had lived my entire life in a conservative Christian environment. I was homeschooled, and I earned my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s at Verity Institute. I was a well-learned kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I have held 8 job titles at 5 departments of 3 companies in 3 states. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on three international business trips. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken 20 church youth group kids to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/thursday-october-12-2006/&#34; title=&#34;Magic Mountain in L.A.&#34;&gt;Magic Mountain in L.A.&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been turned down by the girl I loved. I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/tuesday-september-5-2006/&#34; title=&#34;Surfing in San Diego&#34;&gt;taught Austrian tourists how to surf&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ryanclarke.net/post/this-is-my-thanksgiving/&#34; title=&#34;This is My Thanksgiving&#34;&gt;let go from my job&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten from street vendor carts in Mexico. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in 6 weddings: thrice as groomsman, twice as best man, and once as groom. I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/lost-in-the-superstition-mountains/&#34; title=&#34;Lost in the Superstition Mountains&#34;&gt;lost in the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/lost-in-the-superstition-mountains-part-2/&#34; title=&#34;Lost in the Superstition Mountains, Part 2&#34;&gt;desert for two days&lt;/a&gt; waiting for a helicopter to find us. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved 6 times. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a daughter (another one on is the way). I&amp;rsquo;ve laughed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life goes crazy after you turn twenty: after you leave schooling behind and start doing. There are lots of things to do and lots of things to have happen. Embrace it. Here are a few tips to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;don-t-live-temporarily&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Live Temporarily.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just doing this for now&amp;rdquo; we don&amp;rsquo;t think we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing it for &amp;ldquo;the rest of my life.&amp;rdquo; Mortal life by its very nature is not permanent, why dwell on the fact? Live whole-heartedly where ever you are (Psalm 1:3). Who cares if you only &amp;lsquo;plan&amp;rsquo; to be somewhere for 1 year? Get state residency, join a local church, attend a weekly/monthly group of your interest and settle in. You may only be there for a year, but at least you enjoyed it and belonged. If you end up staying for 20 years, at least you didn&amp;rsquo;t wake up 14 years in and realize you have been living like a homeless nomad, minus the change of scenery. Bloom where you are planted, and if you move, start blooming there too. of course, this principle applies to more than just locations, but jobs, etc. too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;avoid-debt&#34;&gt;Avoid Debt.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt is slavery: don&amp;rsquo;t go there. If you only spend less than what you have you will never be short of money (although you not have many things). A person in debt cannot live more cheaply because they have obligations they cannot refuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;don-t-avoid-responsibility&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Avoid Responsibility.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsibility is power. Responsibility is the voluntary acceptance of the important things in life inspiring you to govern your behavior for the good of others. Irresponsibility seems like more freedom, but in the end you&amp;rsquo;ll feel like a kid, and that is not fun when you are an adult. In the end, irresponsibility makes you feel worthless, but responsibility makes you feel needed, important, and satisfied with the good things you create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;be-involved&#34;&gt;Be Involved&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good marriage is the best thing in life, and children are a close second. The people around us are what make life fun. Don&amp;rsquo;t do it alone. Don&amp;rsquo;t be stingy with who you like, like as many people as possible. Try to help them, good deeds have a way of making their way around, helping everyone, and often helping you in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;become-really-good-at-something&#34;&gt;Become Really Good At Something&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start now, you will be really good at it in 10 years. Pick something you like doing; something that almost makes you feel more energized when you&amp;rsquo;re done with it then when you started, but be sure it&amp;rsquo;s something that someone might pay you for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;make-people-happy&#34;&gt;Make People Happy.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.&amp;rdquo; (Matt. 6:24) Sometimes the word evil sounds like the simplest description. People live with hearts full of hurt, pain, disappointment (or in the words of &lt;em&gt;Les Miserables&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;Life has killed the dream I dreamed&amp;rdquo;): Help ease other&amp;rsquo;s burdens being bring a wee bit o&amp;rsquo; joy where ever possible. A merry heart is so powerful the FDA should regulate it (Prov. 17:22). This decade is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ryanclarke.net/post/true-adventure/&#34; title=&#34;True Adventure&#34;&gt;fraught with adventure&lt;/a&gt;. If you live according to my advice, and even more so if you follow the Bible&amp;rsquo;s wisdom, you can experience much adventure. A word of warning, adventure is sometimes difficult, but it&amp;rsquo;s always rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May God&amp;rsquo;s ample blessings comfort you and bring you joy and peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>As if I would trust my life upon a lie</title>
      <link>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/as-if-i-would-trust-my-life-upon-a-lie/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2008 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ryan Clarke</author>
      <guid>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/as-if-i-would-trust-my-life-upon-a-lie/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Religious people are often called people of faith and participate in faith-based activities. In a culture that uses ‘faith’ so prominently and interchangeably with ‘religion’, I think many people are unaware of the Christian concept of faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I disagree. Hebrews 11:1 defines faith as “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” Substance and evidence are not terms used to describe a mental handicap. If anything, they are meant to convey a confidence beyond any human will power. Mortimer J. Adler sums it up nicely when he writes, “You must always keep in mind that an article of faith is not something that the faithful ‘assume.’ Faith, for those who have it, is the most certain form of knowledge, not a tentative opinion.” A Christian’s faith transcends belief and rests in solid sureness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith is often confused with belief. Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary gives one definition of faith as “firm belief in something for which there is no proof” and another as “sincerity of intentions.” While it includes other and better definitions, these two demonstrate the perceived weakness of faith in our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a scientific and rational culture, proof and objectivity are regarded as prerequisites for trust in anything of importance. However, these same principles are deemed unimportant in matters of postmodern spirituality where everyone must find their own truth. Faith is simply a belief that the believer holds for comfort, tradition’s sake, or some moral expedient: anything but because it is really true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I disagree. Hebrews 11:1 defines faith as “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” Substance and evidence are not terms used to describe a mental handicap. If anything, they are meant to convey a confidence beyond any human will power. Mortimer J. Adler sums it up nicely when he writes, “You must always keep in mind that an article of faith is not something that the faithful ‘assume.’ Faith, for those who have it, is the most certain form of knowledge, not a tentative opinion.” A Christian’s faith transcends belief and rests in solid sureness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, faith is described as the substance of a Christian’s hope: heaven. Popularly, hope is often used to express a wish or optimism, but a Christian’s hope is no mere whim if it has a present substance. Heaven and eternal life already exist and Christians currently possess them through the very faith in Christ which is the evidence of these things not seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christianity is not another wish upon a star. I do not stake my life upon Christ because it makes me feel good. I have faith is Christ because He’s true. Faith is my solid assurance in a definite guarantee. As if I would trust my life upon a lie.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#39;Tis What Season...?</title>
      <link>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/tis-what-season/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2007 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ryan Clarke</author>
      <guid>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/tis-what-season/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By the way, what season is it anyway? I was at Best Buy last night and I walked over to the table where they were selling the holiday gift cards. I say &amp;ldquo;holiday&amp;rdquo; with purpose. I&amp;rsquo;m not using it as a contraction of holy and day used for Christian celebrations, I&amp;rsquo;m using it as an all-purpose, non-religious term for the 25th of December, or more, Thanksgiving through New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day. (When was the last time you wished someone a happy holiday for July 4th? What about the Late Spring Holiday Season of Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day, Memorial Day, Father&amp;rsquo;s Day and Flag day?) So I&amp;rsquo;m standing at the gift card table and there are four different styles to suit everyone: Happy Kwanzaa, Happy Hanukkah, Love and Holiday (with a bride and a groom on it) and Giving Season with a gift. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a &amp;ldquo;Christmas&amp;rdquo;, a manger, or a angel to be seen. Not even a serene looking female angel with long flaxen hair and a trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I&amp;rsquo;m saying is that Christmas was a very big thing: God became man. It deserves a big celebration, and now it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even get a mention from corporate people who &amp;lsquo;know.&amp;rsquo; Sometimes it feels like they have taken the Christ out of Christmas and now they are destroying the last remnant of the X in Xmas. But I can still worship the newborn Christ, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I plan to do, whether it&amp;rsquo;s officially endorsed by Best Buy or not.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Truth and Perception</title>
      <link>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/truth-and-perception/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Dec 2007 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Ryan Clarke</author>
      <guid>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/truth-and-perception/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it amazes me, the incredible arrogance of our intellect. As if our thoughts create reality. There is Truth and then there is Perception. Truth is what it is, but Perception is what we think Truth is. And we think that what we perceive Truth to be is the way Truth really is. Though Truth never changes, Perception does, and the vigilant will quickly realize how transient and impaired our finite grasp of real reality is within ourselves. And thus, before we can discover Truth, we must find unerring Perception. If our feeble attempts at Perception quickly become exposed as theory and opinion, then authority can only be found outside ourself in Knowledge, which is an understanding of Truth. We cannot generate Knowledge. Therefore, we cannot find Truth in its ultimate and purest state: Truth must be given to us. Who will give us Truth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look no farther that the Bible where we find Jesus proclaimed as The Word, the very embodiment of Knowledge. We also see Jesus defining Himself as The Truth. We ask ourself, is this a legitimate claim? The answer is a resounding affirmative since in Genesis we see Jesus making everything. God was, and then He created. God made reality and truth and therefore is intimately qualified to act as the supreme interpreter. Just as truth is unusable without being perceived and perception is dangerous unless it accurately reflects truth, so correct understanding is able to unlock the mysteries of life and allow us to live purposefully and meaningfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, we must endeavor to lay aside our own thinking and the philosophies of man which surround us and immerse ourselves in the knowing instructions of our Creator contained in the Bible. What a marvelous Book, with principles that even a child can live by and the answers to mysteries that have confounded geniuses for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to believe something, I don&amp;rsquo;t need it to be easy or fair or even common-sensical, I just need it to be true, because my life depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once again I find myself reading Psalm 37.
&amp;ldquo;Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight thyself also in the LORD; and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and He shall bring it to pass. And He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for Him.&amp;ldquo;  ~ Psalm 37:3-7a

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I get really mad today. Which is surprising since I&amp;rsquo;m a really easy going person and not much shakes me in that way. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember being mad for months, and then I&amp;rsquo;m fuming. It was kind of scary: I was seconds away from saying some imprudent things. As 1 Corinthians 10:12 says, &amp;ldquo;Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.&amp;rdquo; Fortunately I took heed and called my Mom where she was able to get my mind back on good things (Philippians 4:8).
It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that 1 Corinthians 10:12 is proceeded by some verses on the Israelites in the desert in verses 1-11. &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and did eat the same spiritual meat; and did drink the same spiritual drink: for the drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. But with many of them God was not pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. &amp;hellip; Neither be ye idolaters &amp;hellip; commit fornication &amp;hellip; tempt Christ &amp;hellip; murmur &amp;hellip; as some of them &amp;hellip; and were destroyed of the destroyer. Now these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.&amp;rdquo; Then finally, &amp;ldquo;Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.&amp;rdquo;
And it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to get caught up in Christless actions and attitudes. Take heed. I got a big warning today. Thank God for Mom!

      <title>Psalm 40:9-10</title>

      <guid>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/psalm-40-9-10/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great congregation; Behold, I will not restrain my lips, O Lord, Thou knowest. I have not hidden Thy righteousness within my heart; I have spoken of Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation; I have not concealed Thy lovingkindness and Thy truth from the great congregation.&amp;rdquo;
     ~ Psalm 40:9-10
Most scholars agree (okay, I only checked with Spurgeon&amp;rsquo;s Treasury of Psalms) that this passage, and much of the entire Psalm, is written about Christ and His unwavering proclamation of the Kingdom of God&amp;rsquo;s imminence during His years of ministry. When I read this passage this morning my first thought was on the evangelism training I&amp;rsquo;m going through with my church. When I insert my self in there, and switch all &amp;ldquo;the great congregations&amp;rdquo; out for the &amp;ldquo;the world&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;lost and helpless people.&amp;rdquo;
May I be worthy of the task.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him,
On those who hope for His lovingkindness,
To deliver their soul from death,
And to keep them alive in famine.
Our soul waits for the Lord;
He is our help and our shield.
For our heart rejoices in Him,
Because we trust in His holy name.
Let Thy lovingkindness, O Lord, be upon us,
According as we have hoped in Thee.
   ~   Psalm 33:18-22

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My little children, I am writing these things to you that you may not sin.&amp;rdquo; 1 John 2:1a
It&amp;rsquo;s true. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying in 1 John sin has been less attractive to me. I am sinning less. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing. Of course, John is a realist and knows we&amp;rsquo;re still going to sin. So he finishes that verse: &amp;ldquo;And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.&amp;rdquo; 1 John 2:1b
If you read 1 John you will sin less: it&amp;rsquo;s the point of the book. And it does it by making us realize God&amp;rsquo;s love, and letting us love Him back (1 John 4:10, 19). Listen to this familiar passage that brought me to grateful tears last night:
&amp;ldquo;See how great a love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God: and such we are. For this reason the world does not know us, because it does not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared yet what we shall be. We know that, when He appears, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is. And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself, just as He is pure. Do not marvel if the world hates you. We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death.&amp;rdquo; 1 John 3:1-3, 13-14)

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading 1 John a lot lately. It&amp;rsquo;s a small book so I&amp;rsquo;ve read chapters several times. John&amp;rsquo;s writing makes him sound like the nicest man ever. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how kind the words sound, even though so many of them are convicting and speak strongly against sin in a Christian&amp;rsquo;s life. That&amp;rsquo;s how true Christianity should be, truthful but loving. Read 1 John: it&amp;rsquo;s like getting a hug.
This has been Ryan, promoting a &amp;lsquo;little book&amp;rsquo; of the Bible.
