&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Advice on Your 20th Birthday from the Perspective of 28 Years&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Friend,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decade which you now commence is fraught with adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 20, I had lived my entire life in a conservative Christian environment. I was homeschooled, and I earned my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s at Verity Institute. I was a well-learned kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I have held 8 job titles at 5 departments of 3 companies in 3 states. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on three international business trips. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken 20 church youth group kids to &lt;a href=&#34;/journal/thursday-october-12-2006/&#34; title=&#34;Magic Mountain in L.A.&#34;&gt;Magic Mountain in L.A.&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been turned down by the girl I loved. I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;/journal/tuesday-september-5-2006/&#34; title=&#34;Surfing in San Diego&#34;&gt;taught Austrian tourists how to surf&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href=&#34;/post/this-is-my-thanksgiving/&#34; title=&#34;This is My Thanksgiving&#34;&gt;let go from my job&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten from street vendor carts in Mexico. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in 6 weddings: thrice as groomsman, twice as best man, and once as groom. I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href=&#34;/journal/lost-in-the-superstition-mountains/&#34; title=&#34;Lost in the Superstition Mountains&#34;&gt;lost in the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;/journal/lost-in-the-superstition-mountains-part-2/&#34; title=&#34;Lost in the Superstition Mountains, Part 2&#34;&gt;desert for two days&lt;/a&gt; waiting for a helicopter to find us. I&amp;rsquo;ve moved 6 times. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a daughter (another one on is the way). I&amp;rsquo;ve laughed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life goes crazy after you turn twenty: after you leave schooling behind and start doing. There are lots of things to do and lots of things to have happen. Embrace it. Here are a few tips to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_1&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Live Temporarily.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just doing this for now&amp;rdquo; we don&amp;rsquo;t think we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing it for &amp;ldquo;the rest of my life.&amp;rdquo; Mortal life by its very nature is not permanent, why dwell on the fact? Live whole-heartedly where ever you are (Psalm 1:3). Who cares if you only &amp;lsquo;plan&amp;rsquo; to be somewhere for 1 year? Get state residency, join a local church, attend a weekly/monthly group of your interest and settle in. You may only be there for a year, but at least you enjoyed it and belonged. If you end up staying for 20 years, at least you didn&amp;rsquo;t wake up 14 years in and realize you have been living like a homeless nomad, minus the change of scenery. Bloom where you are planted, and if you move, start blooming there too. of course, this principle applies to more than just locations, but jobs, etc. too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_2&#34;&gt;Avoid Debt.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt is slavery: don&amp;rsquo;t go there. If you only spend less than what you have you will never be short of money (although you not have many things). A person in debt cannot live more cheaply because they have obligations they cannot refuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_3&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Avoid Responsibility.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsibility is power. Responsibility is the voluntary acceptance of the important things in life inspiring you to govern your behavior for the good of others. Irresponsibility seems like more freedom, but in the end you&amp;rsquo;ll feel like a kid, and that is not fun when you are an adult. In the end, irresponsibility makes you feel worthless, but responsibility makes you feel needed, important, and satisfied with the good things you create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_4&#34;&gt;Be Involved&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good marriage is the best thing in life, and children are a close second. The people around us are what make life fun. Don&amp;rsquo;t do it alone. Don&amp;rsquo;t be stingy with who you like, like as many people as possible. Try to help them, good deeds have a way of making their way around, helping everyone, and often helping you in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_5&#34;&gt;Become Really Good At Something&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you start now, you will be really good at it in 10 years. Pick something you like doing; something that almost makes you feel more energized when you&amp;rsquo;re done with it then when you started, but be sure it&amp;rsquo;s something that someone might pay you for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;toc_6&#34;&gt;Make People Happy.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.&amp;rdquo; (Matt. 6:24) Sometimes the word evil sounds like the simplest description. People live with hearts full of hurt, pain, disappointment (or in the words of &lt;em&gt;Les Miserables&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;Life has killed the dream I dreamed&amp;rdquo;): Help ease other&amp;rsquo;s burdens being bring a wee bit o&amp;rsquo; joy where ever possible. A merry heart is so powerful the FDA should regulate it (Prov. 17:22). This decade is &lt;a href=&#34;/post/true-adventure/&#34; title=&#34;True Adventure&#34;&gt;fraught with adventure&lt;/a&gt;. If you live according to my advice, and even more so if you follow the Bible&amp;rsquo;s wisdom, you can experience much adventure. A word of warning, adventure is sometimes difficult, but it&amp;rsquo;s always rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May God&amp;rsquo;s ample blessings comfort you and bring you joy and peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Curse of a Dream Job</title>
      <link>http://ryanclarke.github.io/journal/the-curse-of-a-dream-job/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No sooner does a person get a job they love then it starts to destroy them. Jesus said His burden is easy, and it is a good thing, because the ones we give ourselves rarely are. Good employees think that they have to do their best at work. And then the work expands, bringing discouragement or exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true standard: good employees should do their best in the time they are given. Companies can not own slaves. If they are buying eight hours each day, give them an honest eight. Not ten. Have something else to do with those other hours, besides sleep: develop good hobbies, invest in family. Strong family relationships take time and can not be patched together as easily as work projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good employee who has things to look forward to after work will find that he remains a good employee and has a more fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>True Adventure</title>
      <link>http://ryanclarke.github.io/journal/true-adventure/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“True adventurers have never been plentiful. They who are set down in print as such have been mostly business men with newly invented methods. They have been out after the things they wanted—golden fleeces, holy grails, lady loves, treasure, crowns and fame. The true adventurer goes forth aimless and uncalculating to meet and greet unknown fate. A fine example was the Prodigal Son&amp;ndash;when he started back home.” ~O. Henry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That paragraph from &lt;em&gt;The Green Door&lt;/em&gt; captures the essence of the Christian Adventure. Life is designed to require faith and the life of faith is an Adventure. For some years now I have felt called by God to go to China and learn the Chinese language and I think, “Won’t living in China be an adventure!” However, China is not the Christian Adventure. The Adventure is feeling and following the call of God when it looks impossible. It is desperately caring about the success of a situation when it is shadowed by certain failure in human terms. It is diving whole-heartedly into vague visions of the future when there is no earthly way that it will all work out. It is stepping into the Jordan River in hopes that God will dry it out. The Christian Adventure cannot be separated from prayer: kneeling in the darkness night after night and begging God for direction, begging Him for faith, begging for peace and confidence and contentment and joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Christian Adventure is being willing to calmly follow God into crushing trials because He has promised to never leave me and to work everything together for my good. It is passionately living under the will of Divine Benevolence. Do I have to go to China for adventure? No, I am living the Adventure now. And it just might be that the Adventure will lead me to China. God knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rest my unknown future on Christ who died for me. That is True Adventure and I am a True Adventurer!&lt;/p&gt;
