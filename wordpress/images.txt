content/post/2005-03-06-sunday-march-6-2005.md: I went to the opera Aida last night. I was incredible. With a 60-member cast and 40-piece orchestra, it was a pretty grand production. 2 hours and 45 minutes long. Although I have listened to many operas, and seen one on video, I'd never been to a live show, but what a wonderful experience it was. The singers did not use microphones; they had no need for them. The conductor was very good: his cues were excellent and his beats clear, very important in those fluid, rubato, and rhythmically varied passages that are scattered throughout opera. I didn't really like the oboe player. The Glory the Egypt chorus and march in the second half of Act 2 is a real show stopper. The set and costumes were pretty showy. Unlike the title suggests, Amneris steals the show, followed by Radamès, then Aida. Also there were supertitles in English providing a rough translation on a powerpoint above the stage. That was really nice to keep us all in the know about what the different people were expiring about. If you want to read a synopsis of the opera, go to this link: [Aida Synopsis](http://www.metopera.org/synopses/aida.html). I think I could get hooked on opera-going. I brought my broken pair of binoculars which were nice, but next time I'll have to buy some [opera glasses](http://www.binoculars.com/images/zhu_metro_1.jpg). It was a grand night with *good* company. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Now that's what I call a night!
content/post/2005-03-11-friday-march-11-2005.md: I had a good piano lesson today because I practiced this week. I like my teacher. When I was younger I should have practiced harder, because now I have all this knowledge and desire and not much ability. Accelerated Verity is not the ideal time to catch up, considering my schedule. I'm trying. I watched Sarah play piano for a while tonight. Make magic is more like it: she is incredible! What an inspiration to me to practice. It seems so impossible to me that people can even play all that difficult music, yet Sarah's going to town on these pieces from memory, sounding like amazing \<insert awe here\>. James Beeman also is very good at improvising. His chords are so juicy. I can always tell it's him when I hear the piano because he's using sounds that only he can use. Wow, what a gift. I'm a composer and I think, "I wish I knew how to use that chord." Then I look at myself and say "Lord, use me." Because only God can make me useable. Both Sarah and James are playing in a recital on Saturday evening, I believe, at the FIM. Also some other Verity folks. Be there if you can, it's going to be fantastic.
content/post/2005-04-14-thursday-april-14-2005.md:The only-ever-annual "[Ryan's Hero of the Day Award](http://www.feebleminds-gifs.com/snake-01.gif)" goes to me. I was a hero today. Don't ask me how, I just felt like a hero. Perhaps it was in relation to the way I conquered my room: it is no longer a mess. Or maybe, it truly was only a feeling. As Will Rogers said, "We can't all be heroes, because somebody has to sit on the curb and applaud when they go by." So maybe. I'm good at applause.

content/post/2005-08-10-wednesday-august-10-2005.md: But I got two goals in soccer, a gift for someone, and an encouraging thank-you note. Yes, there is joy in doing, joy in giving, and joy in being appreciated. These little blessings allowed me to keep a smile on today.

content/post/2005-11-26-saturday-november-26-2005.md: I hit some sales today with Mom. Mostly we did Mom Shopping. But we did get to do some Ryan Shopping. As in: Best Buy and Circuit City. At Best Buy I was finally able to use a Christmas gift card from last year: I found a (get ready to be jealous) 1GB USB flash drive for \$20 (\$40 with \$20 rebate). I am so happy. I feel like a materialist letting stuff get me so up like this. But oh well. Finally I found the deal I've been looking for. So now I have all the shopping out of my system for a long time. And Christmas is coming up. So I guess I'll have to go do some more buying soon.
content/post/2005-12-25-sunday-december-25-2005.md: You see, I finally realized that all that expectancy, the hype about decorations, the feeling of "I can't believe it's finally here" was all selfish. Everything pointed towards my gifts. And as I matured I became less selfish and greedy and the amazing aurora the enveloped Christmas faded into a dim fog. I was losing the Christmas Spirit as Christmas became less important to me.

content/post/2006-03-20-monday-march-20-2006.md:This is the most recent family picture, taken at the PIX Theater after my symphony was played. Becky is the one on the far right, beside me. She might be the most generous person I know. She is constantly writing people letters, giving them gifts, and even money. It's a real inspiration to me. I might not have much, but she is way more generous with even less. She is also a very happy person (her middle name is Joy). Many of you Verity people have met her the two times she's been up, for my graduation and the symphony concert. I'm sure you'll all agree that she is an awesome person.

content/post/2007-03-12-monday-march-12-2007.md:The weather here has been mid-seventies, clear, and breezy. The forecast says much more of the same. I want to play tennis!!! Unfortunately, my [main tennis bud](http://xanga.com/sub4faast) is [out of town](http://www.pacificalumni.org/images/reno.jpg). There's a neat new guy in town, Ben, who's been coming to youth group and he's done tennis tournaments (translation: way better than me). I'm going to try to get in a trip to the courts with him sometime this week.

content/post/2007-10-12-friday-october-12-2007.md:Yesterday Pastor Allen gave me a gift certificate to the Phoenix Symphony in appreciation for me filling in for him these last two weeks. I was quite surprised on top of happy. Of all the perfect gifts! So, now I just have to decide what I want to see... and who to bring with me.
content/post/2007-12-24-tis-what-season.md:By the way, what season is it anyway? I was at Best Buy last night and I walked over to the table where they were selling the holiday gift cards. I say "holiday" with purpose. I'm not using it as a contraction of holy and day used for Christian celebrations, I'm using it as an all-purpose, non-religious term for the 25th of December, or more, Thanksgiving through New Year's Day. (When was the last time you wished someone a happy holiday for July 4th? What about the Late Spring Holiday Season of Mother's Day, Memorial Day, Father's Day and Flag day?) So I'm standing at the gift card table and there are four different styles to suit everyone: Happy Kwanzaa, Happy Hanukkah, Love and Holiday (with a bride and a groom on it) and Giving Season with a gift. There wasn't a "Christmas", a manger, or a angel to be seen. Not even a serene looking female angel with long flaxen hair and a trumpet.

Jesus said His burden is easy, and it is a good thing, because the ones we give ourselves rarely are. Good employees think that they have to do their best at work. And then the work expands, bringing discouragement or exhaustion. The true standard: good employees should do their best in the time they are given. Companies can not own slaves. If they are buying eight hours each day, give them an honest eight. Not ten. Have something else to do with those other hours, besides sleep: develop good hobbies, invest in family. Strong family relationships take time and can not be patched together as easily as work projects. A good employee who has things to look forward to after work will find that he remains a good employee and has a more fulfilling life. Avoid burnout.
content/post/2012-03-01-march-1st-is-windows-8-day.md:[![Graphic proof](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/Win8CPStartScreen.png "Windows 8 Consumer Preview start screen")](http://www.ryanclarke.net/post/march-1st-is-windows-8-day/win8cpstartscreen/) So there I was... I'd "known" that the Windows 8 Consumer Preview was coming out in February since //build/ in September. I'd known it was going to be on the "congratulations for surviving 4 more years, here's 24 bonus hours" day since early in the month. I'd known that the download would be finished by quitting time since I started it that morning (it's a slow hose). I popped the install disk into my little old laptop-a sacrificial gesture so that any weird issues wouldn't effect my main battletower-and would you know it: I'd done it again. On this First day of March in the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand Twelve, Windows 8 Consumer Preview dawned for classicalRyan<sup>TM</sup>. The laptop did not spend quality time with me last evening: it communed instead with the Personal Backup Solution<sup>TM</sup>. For the third Windows release in a row, I have completely forgotten to backup my marked-for-destruction hard drive until the cheeky little installer asked what partition I'd like to feed it. Moral: It should have been April 1 today. And Windows 9 will probably get me too.
content/post/2012-08-29-every-screen-is-a-touch-screen.md:[![Babies believe in touch screens](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/BabiesBelieveInTouchScreens.png "Babies believe in touch screens")](http://www.ryanclarke.net/post/every-screen-is-a-touch-screen/babiesbelieveintouchscreens/) There is much talk and controversy in the tech world surrounding Windows 8. One consistant charge is that it might be fine for a tablet, but nobody wants a a touch screen for a "serious" work computer like a laptop or desktop. I disagree. Steven Sinofsky, President of Microsoft's Windows Division, mentioned it a talk how strange it is that we have come to expect touch screens on every electronic device except the most expensive and powerful one we have. Why shouldn't laptops and desktops have touch screens too? Even babies think laptops should have touch screens. Power user types like to say that keyboard and mouse is better, but how can simply lacking touch be better? Keyboard, mouse AND touch seems like a clear improvement. More options. In fact, as a power user myself, I try to avoid the mouse all the time in favor of the keyboard but there are times when you need a pointing device. I would much rather just use my finger than having to fiddle with a mouse for those brief interactions. One day I will have a multiple touch screen desktop, and every screen will be a touch screen.
content/post/2012-10-04-how-to-join-t-mobile-monthly4g.md:T-Mobile is offering customers an incredible catch-22... I mean, deal. I have wanted a Windows Phone for a year now but could not justify paying a smartphone-priced cell plan. So when I saw T-Mobile's \$30 per month online-only plan I pounced. My Windows Phone dreams would happen–and all while saving \$20 over my current Verizon plan. But it's all a cruel trick and the system is broken. You see, the deal is only on the web, so I couldn't buy the \$20 in-store SIM card kit since they don't let SIM kits walk out inactivated. No problem, that's what e-commerce is for. So I got my card online and only paid \$1.06 with shipping. Feel the savings! [![T-Mobile SIM Card](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/TMobileSIM.png "T-Mobile SIM Card")](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/TMobileSIM.png) But on arrival, it turned out to be the full half-acre: way too big to fit the cute little slot in my Nokia Lumia 710. I need micro-SIM, not full SIM. I went back online to get the other kit. Wait a minute, there is no other kit. Yes, I called and no, they do not sell micro-SIMs online at this time. So here's the T-Mobile Web/Store Deadlock™: the website won't provide micro-SIM,the  store won't provide the deal. I won't retell the full three-day saga of phone calls and web searches, but I tried everything and even considered buying a [SIM cutter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FQUWKS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004FQUWKS&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanclanet-20) (it's always amazing how manythings there really are to buy). The system was completely broken and I couldn't figure out why. The frustrating thing was the thought that there's no way I'm the only one trying to do this. In the end I didn't buy the tool, as cool as it looks. Turns out you can simply go into any T-Mobile store and get an activated SIM card switched out for a micro-SIM. Activation involved entering long serial numbers from both SIM and phone into the website and doesn't involve turning the phone on. So I activated the big card online without it ever touching my phone and got the deal. Then went into the store and asked for a switch-out to micro-SIM. Total price: free. The system is not broken; instead it is simple and friendly. Too bad they never say how to do it! So I'm putting it here so that the world might know.
content/post/2014-04-14-using-factories-for-cleanliness-in-android-testing.md:I am on a team building a native Android app for a local credit union. We are doing some really cool stuff around testing with unit tests, automated instrumentation tests using spoon, and manual user experience testing. We are working in a low-ceremony, flow-based process with continuous client feedback. One tool we are using to greatly improve our test quality is factories. Android uses Java and so the very name "factory" on a Java project (for a credit union, no less) is probably making you think of BaseAbstractStrategyBuilderFactoryImpl and such, but such enterprisyness is not the case. [![Factory chimneys billowing polution](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/pollution-295305_6401.png)](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/pollution-295305_6401.png) In reality, factories aren't obligatorily complex: we are simply building an object. If there was any business logic going on I'm sure it would be more complex, but we're just using them in tests to make writing, debugging, and understanding them easier. Even with a test-first development flow, many tests end up needing some state setup to run correctly and hit to correct code paths. And state setup is a chore. Java is fairly verbose. Factories allow us to hide that boring instantiation and assignment snooze-festing in a separate place from the main test function. Take this example from a bit of code I've been working on recently. I've added some Arrange, Act, Assert comments to make this easier to follow.

content/post/2005-03-06-sunday-march-6-2005.md: I went to the opera Aida last night. I was incredible. With a 60-member cast and 40-piece orchestra, it was a pretty grand production. 2 hours and 45 minutes long. Although I have listened to many operas, and seen one on video, I'd never been to a live show, but what a wonderful experience it was. The singers did not use microphones; they had no need for them. The conductor was very good: his cues were excellent and his beats clear, very important in those fluid, rubato, and rhythmically varied passages that are scattered throughout opera. I didn't really like the oboe player. The Glory the Egypt chorus and march in the second half of Act 2 is a real show stopper. The set and costumes were pretty showy. Unlike the title suggests, Amneris steals the show, followed by Radamès, then Aida. Also there were supertitles in English providing a rough translation on a powerpoint above the stage. That was really nice to keep us all in the know about what the different people were expiring about. If you want to read a synopsis of the opera, go to this link: [Aida Synopsis](http://www.metopera.org/synopses/aida.html). I think I could get hooked on opera-going. I brought my broken pair of binoculars which were nice, but next time I'll have to buy some [opera glasses](http://www.binoculars.com/images/zhu_metro_1.jpg). It was a grand night with *good* company. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Now that's what I call a night!

Don't ask me how, I just felt like a hero. Perhaps it was in relation to the way I conquered my room: it is no longer a mess. Or maybe, it truly was only a feeling. As Will Rogers said, "We can't all be heroes, because somebody has to sit on the curb and applaud when they go by." So maybe. I'm good at applause.

content/post/2007-03-12-monday-march-12-2007.md:The weather here has been mid-seventies, clear, and breezy. The forecast says much more of the same. I want to play tennis!!! Unfortunately, my [main tennis bud](http://xanga.com/sub4faast) is [out of town](http://www.pacificalumni.org/images/reno.jpg). There's a neat new guy in town, Ben, who's been coming to youth group and he's done tennis tournaments (translation: way better than me). I'm going to try to get in a trip to the courts with him sometime this week.

Jesus said His burden is easy, and it is a good thing, because the ones we give ourselves rarely are. Good employees think that they have to do their best at work. And then the work expands, bringing discouragement or exhaustion. The true standard: good employees should do their best in the time they are given. Companies can not own slaves. If they are buying eight hours each day, give them an honest eight. Not ten. Have something else to do with those other hours, besides sleep: develop good hobbies, invest in family. Strong family relationships take time and can not be patched together as easily as work projects. A good employee who has things to look forward to after work will find that he remains a good employee and has a more fulfilling life. Avoid burnout.

I'd "known" that the Windows 8 Consumer Preview was coming out in February since //build/ in September. I'd known it was going to be on the "congratulations for surviving 4 more years, here's 24 bonus hours" day since early in the month. I'd known that the download would be finished by quitting time since I started it that morning (it's a slow hose). I popped the install disk into my little old laptop-a sacrificial gesture so that any weird issues wouldn't effect my main battletower-and would you know it: I'd done it again. On this First day of March in the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand Twelve, Windows 8 Consumer Preview dawned for classicalRyan<sup>TM</sup>. The laptop did not spend quality time with me last evening: it communed instead with the Personal Backup Solution<sup>TM</sup>. For the third Windows release in a row, I have completely forgotten to backup my marked-for-destruction hard drive until the cheeky little installer asked what partition I'd like to feed it. Moral: It should have been April 1 today. And Windows 9 will probably get me too.
content/post/2012-08-29-every-screen-is-a-touch-screen.md:[![Babies believe in touch screens](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/BabiesBelieveInTouchScreens.png "Babies believe in touch screens")](http://www.ryanclarke.net/post/every-screen-is-a-touch-screen/babiesbelieveintouchscreens/) There is much talk and controversy in the tech world surrounding Windows 8. One consistant charge is that it might be fine for a tablet, but nobody wants a a touch screen for a "serious" work computer like a laptop or desktop. I disagree. Steven Sinofsky, President of Microsoft's Windows Division, mentioned it a talk how strange it is that we have come to expect touch screens on every electronic device except the most expensive and powerful one we have. Why shouldn't laptops and desktops have touch screens too? Even babies think laptops should have touch screens. Power user types like to say that keyboard and mouse is better, but how can simply lacking touch be better? Keyboard, mouse AND touch seems like a clear improvement. More options. In fact, as a power user myself, I try to avoid the mouse all the time in favor of the keyboard but there are times when you need a pointing device. I would much rather just use my finger than having to fiddle with a mouse for those brief interactions. One day I will have a multiple touch screen desktop, and every screen will be a touch screen.
content/post/2012-10-04-how-to-join-t-mobile-monthly4g.md:T-Mobile is offering customers an incredible catch-22... I mean, deal. I have wanted a Windows Phone for a year now but could not justify paying a smartphone-priced cell plan. So when I saw T-Mobile's \$30 per month online-only plan I pounced. My Windows Phone dreams would happen–and all while saving \$20 over my current Verizon plan. But it's all a cruel trick and the system is broken. You see, the deal is only on the web, so I couldn't buy the \$20 in-store SIM card kit since they don't let SIM kits walk out inactivated. No problem, that's what e-commerce is for. So I got my card online and only paid \$1.06 with shipping. Feel the savings! [![T-Mobile SIM Card](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/TMobileSIM.png "T-Mobile SIM Card")](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/TMobileSIM.png) But on arrival, it turned out to be the full half-acre: way too big to fit the cute little slot in my Nokia Lumia 710. I need micro-SIM, not full SIM. I went back online to get the other kit. Wait a minute, there is no other kit. Yes, I called and no, they do not sell micro-SIMs online at this time. So here's the T-Mobile Web/Store Deadlock™: the website won't provide micro-SIM,the  store won't provide the deal. I won't retell the full three-day saga of phone calls and web searches, but I tried everything and even considered buying a [SIM cutter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FQUWKS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004FQUWKS&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanclanet-20) (it's always amazing how manythings there really are to buy). The system was completely broken and I couldn't figure out why. The frustrating thing was the thought that there's no way I'm the only one trying to do this. In the end I didn't buy the tool, as cool as it looks. Turns out you can simply go into any T-Mobile store and get an activated SIM card switched out for a micro-SIM. Activation involved entering long serial numbers from both SIM and phone into the website and doesn't involve turning the phone on. So I activated the big card online without it ever touching my phone and got the deal. Then went into the store and asked for a switch-out to micro-SIM. Total price: free. The system is not broken; instead it is simple and friendly. Too bad they never say how to do it! So I'm putting it here so that the world might know.
content/post/2014-04-14-using-factories-for-cleanliness-in-android-testing.md:I am on a team building a native Android app for a local credit union. We are doing some really cool stuff around testing with unit tests, automated instrumentation tests using spoon, and manual user experience testing. We are working in a low-ceremony, flow-based process with continuous client feedback. One tool we are using to greatly improve our test quality is factories. Android uses Java and so the very name "factory" on a Java project (for a credit union, no less) is probably making you think of BaseAbstractStrategyBuilderFactoryImpl and such, but such enterprisyness is not the case. [![Factory chimneys billowing polution](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/pollution-295305_6401.png)](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/pollution-295305_6401.png) In reality, factories aren't obligatorily complex: we are simply building an object. If there was any business logic going on I'm sure it would be more complex, but we're just using them in tests to make writing, debugging, and understanding them easier. Even with a test-first development flow, many tests end up needing some state setup to run correctly and hit to correct code paths. And state setup is a chore. Java is fairly verbose. Factories allow us to hide that boring instantiation and assignment snooze-festing in a separate place from the main test function. Take this example from a bit of code I've been working on recently. I've added some Arrange, Act, Assert comments to make this easier to follow.

content/post/2005-03-06-sunday-march-6-2005.md: I went to the opera Aida last night. I was incredible. With a 60-member cast and 40-piece orchestra, it was a pretty grand production. 2 hours and 45 minutes long. Although I have listened to many operas, and seen one on video, I'd never been to a live show, but what a wonderful experience it was. The singers did not use microphones; they had no need for them. The conductor was very good: his cues were excellent and his beats clear, very important in those fluid, rubato, and rhythmically varied passages that are scattered throughout opera. I didn't really like the oboe player. The Glory the Egypt chorus and march in the second half of Act 2 is a real show stopper. The set and costumes were pretty showy. Unlike the title suggests, Amneris steals the show, followed by Radamès, then Aida. Also there were supertitles in English providing a rough translation on a powerpoint above the stage. That was really nice to keep us all in the know about what the different people were expiring about. If you want to read a synopsis of the opera, go to this link: [Aida Synopsis](http://www.metopera.org/synopses/aida.html). I think I could get hooked on opera-going. I brought my broken pair of binoculars which were nice, but next time I'll have to buy some [opera glasses](http://www.binoculars.com/images/zhu_metro_1.jpg). It was a grand night with *good* company. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Now that's what I call a night!
content/post/2005-03-11-friday-march-11-2005.md: I had a good piano lesson today because I practiced this week. I like my teacher. When I was younger I should have practiced harder, because now I have all this knowledge and desire and not much ability. Accelerated Verity is not the ideal time to catch up, considering my schedule. I'm trying. I watched Sarah play piano for a while tonight. Make magic is more like it: she is incredible! What an inspiration to me to practice. It seems so impossible to me that people can even play all that difficult music, yet Sarah's going to town on these pieces from memory, sounding like amazing \<insert awe here\>. James Beeman also is very good at improvising. His chords are so juicy. I can always tell it's him when I hear the piano because he's using sounds that only he can use. Wow, what a gift. I'm a composer and I think, "I wish I knew how to use that chord." Then I look at myself and say "Lord, use me." Because only God can make me useable. Both Sarah and James are playing in a recital on Saturday evening, I believe, at the FIM. Also some other Verity folks. Be there if you can, it's going to be fantastic.

Don't ask me how, I just felt like a hero. Perhaps it was in relation to the way I conquered my room: it is no longer a mess. Or maybe, it truly was only a feeling. As Will Rogers said, "We can't all be heroes, because somebody has to sit on the curb and applaud when they go by." So maybe. I'm good at applause.

At Best Buy I was finally able to use a Christmas gift card from last year: I found a (get ready to be jealous) 1GB USB flash drive for \$20 (\$40 with \$20 rebate). I am so happy. I feel like a materialist letting stuff get me so up like this. But oh well. Finally I found the deal I've been looking for. So now I have all the shopping out of my system for a long time. And Christmas is coming up. So I guess I'll have to go do some more buying soon.

Everything pointed towards my gifts. And as I matured I became less selfish and greedy and the amazing aurora the enveloped Christmas faded into a dim fog. I was losing the Christmas Spirit as Christmas became less important to me.

content/post/2006-03-20-monday-march-20-2006.md:This is the most recent family picture, taken at the PIX Theater after my symphony was played. Becky is the one on the far right, beside me. She might be the most generous person I know. She is constantly writing people letters, giving them gifts, and even money. It's a real inspiration to me. I might not have much, but she is way more generous with even less. She is also a very happy person (her middle name is Joy). Many of you Verity people have met her the two times she's been up, for my graduation and the symphony concert. I'm sure you'll all agree that she is an awesome person.

I got out early at 12:30 and spent most of the afternoon looking for rental houses, since I'm not finding any apartments. I'm thinking about [Gillette Castle](http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/images/gilext1.jpg), but the cost of moving it here from Connecticut is prohibitive.

Unfortunately, my [main tennis bud](http://xanga.com/sub4faast) is [out of town](http://www.pacificalumni.org/images/reno.jpg). There's a neat new guy in town, Ben, who's been coming to youth group and he's done tennis tournaments (translation: way better than me). I'm going to try to get in a trip to the courts with him sometime this week.

content/post/2007-10-12-friday-october-12-2007.md:Yesterday Pastor Allen gave me a gift certificate to the Phoenix Symphony in appreciation for me filling in for him these last two weeks. I was quite surprised on top of happy. Of all the perfect gifts! So, now I just have to decide what I want to see... and who to bring with me.
content/post/2007-12-24-tis-what-season.md:By the way, what season is it anyway? I was at Best Buy last night and I walked over to the table where they were selling the holiday gift cards. I say "holiday" with purpose. I'm not using it as a contraction of holy and day used for Christian celebrations, I'm using it as an all-purpose, non-religious term for the 25th of December, or more, Thanksgiving through New Year's Day. (When was the last time you wished someone a happy holiday for July 4th? What about the Late Spring Holiday Season of Mother's Day, Memorial Day, Father's Day and Flag day?) So I'm standing at the gift card table and there are four different styles to suit everyone: Happy Kwanzaa, Happy Hanukkah, Love and Holiday (with a bride and a groom on it) and Giving Season with a gift. There wasn't a "Christmas", a manger, or a angel to be seen. Not even a serene looking female angel with long flaxen hair and a trumpet.

Jesus said His burden is easy, and it is a good thing, because the ones we give ourselves rarely are. Good employees think that they have to do their best at work. And then the work expands, bringing discouragement or exhaustion. The true standard: good employees should do their best in the time they are given. Companies can not own slaves. If they are buying eight hours each day, give them an honest eight. Not ten. Have something else to do with those other hours, besides sleep: develop good hobbies, invest in family. Strong family relationships take time and can not be patched together as easily as work projects. A good employee who has things to look forward to after work will find that he remains a good employee and has a more fulfilling life. Avoid burnout.
content/post/2012-03-01-march-1st-is-windows-8-day.md:[![Graphic proof](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/Win8CPStartScreen.png "Windows 8 Consumer Preview start screen")](http://www.ryanclarke.net/post/march-1st-is-windows-8-day/win8cpstartscreen/) So there I was... I'd "known" that the Windows 8 Consumer Preview was coming out in February since //build/ in September. I'd known it was going to be on the "congratulations for surviving 4 more years, here's 24 bonus hours" day since early in the month. I'd known that the download would be finished by quitting time since I started it that morning (it's a slow hose). I popped the install disk into my little old laptop-a sacrificial gesture so that any weird issues wouldn't effect my main battletower-and would you know it: I'd done it again. On this First day of March in the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand Twelve, Windows 8 Consumer Preview dawned for classicalRyan<sup>TM</sup>. The laptop did not spend quality time with me last evening: it communed instead with the Personal Backup Solution<sup>TM</sup>. For the third Windows release in a row, I have completely forgotten to backup my marked-for-destruction hard drive until the cheeky little installer asked what partition I'd like to feed it. Moral: It should have been April 1 today. And Windows 9 will probably get me too.
content/post/2012-08-29-every-screen-is-a-touch-screen.md:[![Babies believe in touch screens](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/BabiesBelieveInTouchScreens.png "Babies believe in touch screens")](http://www.ryanclarke.net/post/every-screen-is-a-touch-screen/babiesbelieveintouchscreens/) There is much talk and controversy in the tech world surrounding Windows 8. One consistant charge is that it might be fine for a tablet, but nobody wants a a touch screen for a "serious" work computer like a laptop or desktop. I disagree. Steven Sinofsky, President of Microsoft's Windows Division, mentioned it a talk how strange it is that we have come to expect touch screens on every electronic device except the most expensive and powerful one we have. Why shouldn't laptops and desktops have touch screens too? Even babies think laptops should have touch screens. Power user types like to say that keyboard and mouse is better, but how can simply lacking touch be better? Keyboard, mouse AND touch seems like a clear improvement. More options. In fact, as a power user myself, I try to avoid the mouse all the time in favor of the keyboard but there are times when you need a pointing device. I would much rather just use my finger than having to fiddle with a mouse for those brief interactions. One day I will have a multiple touch screen desktop, and every screen will be a touch screen.
content/post/2012-10-04-how-to-join-t-mobile-monthly4g.md:T-Mobile is offering customers an incredible catch-22... I mean, deal. I have wanted a Windows Phone for a year now but could not justify paying a smartphone-priced cell plan. So when I saw T-Mobile's \$30 per month online-only plan I pounced. My Windows Phone dreams would happen–and all while saving \$20 over my current Verizon plan. But it's all a cruel trick and the system is broken. You see, the deal is only on the web, so I couldn't buy the \$20 in-store SIM card kit since they don't let SIM kits walk out inactivated. No problem, that's what e-commerce is for. So I got my card online and only paid \$1.06 with shipping. Feel the savings! [![T-Mobile SIM Card](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/TMobileSIM.png "T-Mobile SIM Card")](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/TMobileSIM.png) But on arrival, it turned out to be the full half-acre: way too big to fit the cute little slot in my Nokia Lumia 710. I need micro-SIM, not full SIM. I went back online to get the other kit. Wait a minute, there is no other kit. Yes, I called and no, they do not sell micro-SIMs online at this time. So here's the T-Mobile Web/Store Deadlock™: the website won't provide micro-SIM,the  store won't provide the deal. I won't retell the full three-day saga of phone calls and web searches, but I tried everything and even considered buying a [SIM cutter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FQUWKS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004FQUWKS&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanclanet-20) (it's always amazing how manythings there really are to buy). The system was completely broken and I couldn't figure out why. The frustrating thing was the thought that there's no way I'm the only one trying to do this. In the end I didn't buy the tool, as cool as it looks. Turns out you can simply go into any T-Mobile store and get an activated SIM card switched out for a micro-SIM. Activation involved entering long serial numbers from both SIM and phone into the website and doesn't involve turning the phone on. So I activated the big card online without it ever touching my phone and got the deal. Then went into the store and asked for a switch-out to micro-SIM. Total price: free. The system is not broken; instead it is simple and friendly. Too bad they never say how to do it! So I'm putting it here so that the world might know.
content/post/2014-04-14-using-factories-for-cleanliness-in-android-testing.md:I am on a team building a native Android app for a local credit union. We are doing some really cool stuff around testing with unit tests, automated instrumentation tests using spoon, and manual user experience testing. We are working in a low-ceremony, flow-based process with continuous client feedback. One tool we are using to greatly improve our test quality is factories. Android uses Java and so the very name "factory" on a Java project (for a credit union, no less) is probably making you think of BaseAbstractStrategyBuilderFactoryImpl and such, but such enterprisyness is not the case. [![Factory chimneys billowing polution](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/pollution-295305_6401.png)](http://www.ryanclarke.net/wp-content/uploads/pollution-295305_6401.png) In reality, factories aren't obligatorily complex: we are simply building an object. If there was any business logic going on I'm sure it would be more complex, but we're just using them in tests to make writing, debugging, and understanding them easier. Even with a test-first development flow, many tests end up needing some state setup to run correctly and hit to correct code paths. And state setup is a chore. Java is fairly verbose. Factories allow us to hide that boring instantiation and assignment snooze-festing in a separate place from the main test function. Take this example from a bit of code I've been working on recently. I've added some Arrange, Act, Assert comments to make this easier to follow.
