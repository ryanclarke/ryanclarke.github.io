        <p>Home is good.
 I went shopping with Mom today. I don&rsquo;t really like shopping when I can&rsquo;t haggle or pay in yuan. But it wasn&rsquo;t so bad, we were looking at electronics. And I was with my Mom. So we talked. And talked some more. I have so much to talk about with my Mom after being away for so long, and going to China. Stuff that I forget to say on the phone, or don&rsquo;t think to talk about till we&rsquo;re looking at each other. I don&rsquo;t know, I guess I&rsquo;d have to say that Moms are one of the best things in life. And Chick-fil-A. If they had one of those in the U of M Pavillion, I&rsquo;d be broke.
 I guess quite a few little things have happened in Flint since I left two days ago. Oh well, I&rsquo;m always missing something somewhere. In economic terms: opportunity cost. I&rsquo;ve never been in a snowstorm before. Eight inches in one night I hear, wow.
 I&rsquo;m coming back tomorrow. I will arrive at the RCI between 2:00 and 2:10 pm. If a welcome party would like to assemble to greet me back to the white north, that would be the time. If no one shows up, I&rsquo;ll track you down. Well, I&rsquo;ll probably just say hi at dinner. That&rsquo;ll work. Can&rsquo;t wait to see you all.
