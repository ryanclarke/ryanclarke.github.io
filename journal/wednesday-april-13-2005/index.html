        <p>&ldquo;Great minds think.&rdquo;
 I don&rsquo;t know who came along and added &ldquo;alike&rdquo; to that quote. Idiots think alike. In fact, there are whole branches of science whose sole purpose is to classify idiots under insane scientific terms. Even sheep, the epitome of stupidness, think alike. Even last one of them. But, &ldquo;Great minds think.&rdquo; Moral of this story: use your head. Humans are the only creatures with a large capacity for reason, yet often we let are ability to ponder each move laspe as were prefer the comfortable automation of habit. So many of our problems come from doing something without thinking. Some people&rsquo;s head might have a mind of there own, but you can be a great mind and use your head. I hereby challenge you to live smartly.
 I almost beat Callie in pingpong today. And yes, that is newsworthy: 15 points against her is a miracle for me.
