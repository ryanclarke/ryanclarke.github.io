        <p>When I die I want to be a story, not a date. I want to be a memory, not a number. I want to be a inspirational legacy, not dry fact. What will I get when I die? Will it be a biography or a gravestone? May it be a something that will minister to people yet to be born after I&rsquo;m gone. Psalm 102:18 &ldquo;Write this down for the next generation so people not yet born will praise GOD.&rdquo; That is what I want: a continuing testimony. Pastor Shoemaker had a great chapel on this subject this morning.
 Well, Visitation Weekend was fun. I enjoyed it. Today I played soccer; now I&rsquo;m tired. But I&rsquo;m not going to sleep because I&rsquo;m going to The Fiddler on the Roof tonight. So that is just about my whole day, so far. And one of my shoelaces broke during Symposium, go figure. That has never happened to me before.
