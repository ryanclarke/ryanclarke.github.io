        <p>From the epilogue of Until the Final Hour (this is a followup post to the ones on Saturday the 18th and Monday the 20th):
&ldquo;Only later does she [Traudl Junge] link her [decades-long, postwar] depression with the atrocities of the Nazi regime, which are in such painful contrast to what she felt was her innocuous role in the Third Reich. Guilt feelings of an increasingly concrete nature weigh down on her - suddenly even the excuse &lsquo;You were so young at the time&rsquo;, which had comforted her for so long [and protected her from war crimes charges], seemed hollow.
       &ldquo;At that time I must have often walked past the commemorative plaque to
       Sophie Scholl in Franz-Joseph-Strasse without noticing it. One day I did,
       and I was terribly shocked when I realized that she was executed in 1943,
       just when I was beginning my own job with Hitler. Sophie Scholl had orig-
       inally been a BDM [a program within Hitler Youth] member herself, a year
       younger than me, and she saw clearly that she was dealing with a criminal
       regime. All of a sudden I had no excuse any more.&ldquo;&rdquo;
I hope she found forgiveness with God before she died.
I thought this was powerful, this combination of two stories, because we find two almost identical people (same age, same city, same family background) and two wildly different lives. Sophie stood up for truth at the cost of her life; Traudl goes with the cultural current and ends up with a life of guilt and regret. Traudl writes in 2002, just before her death: (emphasis mine)
       &ldquo;Over the last thirty-five years I have learned to admit that in 1942, when
       I was twenty-two and eager for adventure, I was fascinated by Adolf Hitler,
       thought him an agreeable employer, paternal and friendly, and deliberately
       ignored the warning voice inside of me, although I heard it clearly
       enough. I have learned to admit that I enjoyed working for him almost to
       the bitter end. After the revelation of his crime, I shall always live with a
       sense that I must share the guilt.&rdquo;
So the question this episode in history asks us is: will you stand up for truth or will you follow the culture? &ldquo;All that&rsquo;s necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&rdquo; Edmund Burke.
