        <p>I can still say I&rsquo;ve never been in a wreck.
This morning I didn&rsquo;t have to be into work until 10:00. So I managed to get the utilities registered to my new house: electric, water, cable internet and gas. I also registered at the address at the post office and got an AZ driver&rsquo;s licence. So I was busy. I was just on my way to the North side of town to go to work when I realized I had left my cell phone at the Dept. Motor Vehicles. I went back and got it, right where I&rsquo;d set it down for the picture.
I was in the turn lane on Main Street to get on the Beeline Highway when the dilapidated, lime green pickup truck with the violently pro-gun bumper stickers started backing up towards me. I couldn&rsquo;t back up because I had a ritzy white SUV behind me. So I watched as the sickly-colored jalopy, loudly pouring thick smoke out it&rsquo;s exhaust pipe, coasted into my front bumper. The driver looked upset. But his wild hand motions and facial expressions and scruffy appearance made him look more like the character from a wanted poster than a fellow motorist. I mentally noted his licence plate.
We pulled out onto Beeline Highway and he was going really slow in the slow lane, so I passed him in the fast lane (35 mph) and cut across his front into a carwash. He followed. I guess that&rsquo;s what his charade meant: &ldquo;pull over at the next place.&rdquo; He and his little son got out and he appologized as we looked at my bumper. It&rsquo;s plastic. On either side of the front place is a little plastic bulge. He bumped the bulge and cracked a little paint. I tell you what, even I can push the bulge. I told he not to worry about it. He said he was on the way to get his clutched fixed. Sure enough, less than a mile up the road he turned into a mechanic&rsquo;s shop.
So it all ended well. And I can still say I&rsquo;ve never been in a wreck.
I&rsquo;m stay at work late again doing that putrid health stuff. At least they pay us (the company) a killing for each kilogram of powder we make. So somebody must think it&rsquo;s valuable.
Tomorrow morning I&rsquo;m going to the Beaver Valley Fire Department&rsquo;s pancake breakfast. Beaver Valley is the community where &lsquo;my&rsquo; cabin is, nestled in and surrounded be the Tonto National Forest on all sides. Fire Departments are popular out here in the tindered forests of Arizona. So we&rsquo;ll see how good they cook.
