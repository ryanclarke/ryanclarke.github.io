        <p>Apparently I have been tagged. I guess that makes me feel special. To know that I am so highly valued that I have the same privilege that everyone else does of making a public spectacle of myself is truly overwhelming. I’m speechless. Therefore I will say nothing.</p>

<p>Because, there are a few things you should know. There are no weird things about me: those are just normal personality traits. I am one of very few normal people left. It is appalling how few normal people I run into these days. I commend the minute but determined minority that has resisted this latest fad to bare all our imagined uniqueness before an audience consisting in part of unknown websurfers. Therefore, I will say nothing.</p>

<p>Now, true, some of you may be saying, “nobody is perfect.” But imperfection does not imply having five weird characteristics. Although I must confess, I used to engage in many activities that some would consider weird. For instance, I used to be a fanatical collector of lead chunks, specializing in two main categories: tire weights found in supermarket parking lots, and used bullets extracted from a tree stump target. However, for the most part I was a very normal child with a fear of clowns and broccoli and love for large cardboard boxes and digging holes for my sisters to fall into. Therefore, I will say nothing.</p>

<p>As for hitting anyone else with this burden, I prefer to follow Christ’s command and turn the other cheek. Therefore, I will say nothing.</p>
