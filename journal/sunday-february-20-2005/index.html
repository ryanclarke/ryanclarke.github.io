        <p>One last batch of China pictures! On Tuesday of the last week we went to Hangzhou (which is pronounced &ldquo;hung-joe&rdquo;). Some of the most beautiful spots in China we saw there. Thank you to the various photographers from whom I borrowed several of these and the preceeding pictures: Margie, Kendra, and Ben.
 From the top of a tall tower, Leifeng Pagota, we could see out over West Lake, the biggest feature of Hangzhou.

 There in the middle of the lake you see an island called Three Pools Mirroring the Moon. It seemed like several small islands connected by short bridges, but I guess it was really one island with three big pools connected by little streams. We went out there on a boat and it was gorgeous. It the distant background you can see Leifeng Pagota.

 And lastly, three nice pictures from random rock gardens. My were they pretty. And those circular doorways were quite popular. There are many pictures of various folks from the trip standing sidways ect. in them.

 Many ponds and little pagota-gezebos scattered around.

 And bridges everywhere. The foliage was so green for being in the middle of winter.

 Well folks, there are thousands of pictures taken by many people to document the trip, but I hope the few I chose demostrate the normal variety of my experience in China. Many of these pictures were taken by Shari, Margie, Ben, and Kendra, of course, I took some also, but I chose them because they captured what I saw, and often captured me. So, it was fun.
