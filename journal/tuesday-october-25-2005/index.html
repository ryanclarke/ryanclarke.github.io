        <p>It was the day off from class. Fairly restful.
 I taught the girls in the Wisdom Booklet department how to run Finale today. It was so the could do up the hymns on the back of the booklets better. Funny thing, their Finale was on a Mac. So many of the shortcut keys (and even just the keys period!) are different. I spent a good deal of the time just figuring out how to do stuff on a different platform:&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Splat-Zed. On Windows I use Ctrl-Zed.&rdquo; (Yes, two of the girls were Canadian) Anyway, it was pretty funny. They were all happy with what I showed them, so if you notice an improvement in the hymns on the back of the Wisdom Booklets, you&rsquo;ve got those girls to thank for it. Very fast learners, which is nice, because I was having to learn fast myself.
