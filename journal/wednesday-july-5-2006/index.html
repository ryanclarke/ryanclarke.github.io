        <p>People watch NASCAR to see wrecks. People watch fireworks in Payson to see raging forest fires. (sorry for the generalizations)
Fortunately, the people of Payson were disappointed this year even though the city hierarchy decided to ignore the extreme fire hazard and have the gigantic display anyway. Every fireman in the area came to see the show, for some reason&hellip;
On a personal note, I should have hot water in The Vicarage by tomorrow afternoon! I couldn&rsquo;t get the pilot to light (it&rsquo;s gas) so I called the church. They sent a technician over and they replaced a part that didn&rsquo;t help. So the problem was this expensive part that they can only get in the valley (Phoenix area), so they&rsquo;re just getting us a whole new water heater. The other one was an antique anyway. Don&rsquo;t you just love these modern conveniences? I&rsquo;ll be able to shower at home now, instead of at work!
