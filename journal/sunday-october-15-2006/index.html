<div id="post">
  <p>It was a pretty all-around good day. Faas and I went to both services this morning. It was neat to hear the differences in the sermons. So alike, but a few little changes in delivery. I like being able to sing really loud with all the other Christians.
After the service we took some folks out for lunch at Macky&rsquo;s, a delightful local restaurant. It ended up being quite a few people. Pastor Allen, the three Hollingsworth kids (Nneka, etc) and two of their friends, and the Smith family. It was a lot of fun. After having nothing to do with our money other than buy bagels and paper plates, a few taxes and a tithe, and then stash the remainder in a nationally recognized financial institution - it&rsquo;s good to spend some on others. I think the satisfaction from generosity is underrated. &ldquo;Buying for others - the new materialism.&rdquo; And what a blast we had! Good conversations. It was kind of funny, we were basically out of cash. Faas doesn&rsquo;t carry any, and I always do, but was low. So we only managed to tip about 12%. I moseyed over the the waiter and told him we&rsquo;d get the rest to him next week. He kind of smiled because he sees us so often. Pastor Shoe had it right when he put a big emphasis on tipping well. It&rsquo;s amazing how big an impact just a few dollars can have. Especially when it&rsquo;s obvious you just came from church - we need to be a good witness of other-centeredness.
This afternoon we played some soccer over at Rumsey with a bunch of Mexicans and highschoolers. Also a few older guys. Tons of fun. There&rsquo;s this one guy Arturo who is really good and really likes to help us out and show us some moves. He also goes to Ponderosa Baptist with us.
That was a pretty rambling post about boring ordinary (if you weren&rsquo;t there). If you read it all, thank you. If you only just skimmed through it, join the crowd, I did too.
