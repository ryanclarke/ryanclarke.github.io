        <p>Well nothing is happening here that anyone but music theory geek would find interesting. A theory buff would be loving every moment though, and so I am. But other than that nothing happened. By the way, here at HQ they only serve one meal a day, so we have to make our own breakfast and dinner.
 That reminds me. I made a sandwich for dinner. A sandwich. I decided it would taste better if I gave the bread a light frying with a tiny touch of oil. Unfortunately, the little bit extra oil combined with highest heat and too much cook time was overkill. The fire alarm started going off. So I reaching in the pan and burned my thumb. I threw the bread on the floor. Oh no, that was dinner. Then I stuck my thumb under the faucet, but the faucet doesn&rsquo;t work right, so it sprayed water all over the counter and me. And the stove, causing huge clouds of steam to form, as if the smoke wasn&rsquo;t enought. Then I took the pan off the stove and spilled some in JRod&rsquo;s noodles. Sorry JRod. He started yelling about the alarm, which reminded me, oh yeah, that thing is ringing. So I started to to follow JRod&rsquo;s directions and open a window but I took a wrong turn at the stove and almost ran into the spectator gathering at our open door. So I ran the other way into the bedroom and tried to open the window. Ouch! That&rsquo;s right, I just burned my finger. I think I heard that this used to be a mental asylum, well, the windows are perfect. No one could get out of one of these windows here, I had enought trouble just getting air out. Just about then the fire alarm stopped sounding. So I picked up my burnt piece of bread and the other previously toasted slice and made a sandwich. It actually tasted really good, although the top slice probably moved my heart attack ahead two years. I guess Sandy was mentioning Callie&rsquo;s percieved lack of <a href="http://www.xanga.com/item.aspx?user=verityworkaholic&amp;tab=weblogs&amp;uid=224611028">cooking skills</a>. Well, this is how I do it. I consider myself as a really good cook. Let&rsquo;s just say, with cooking like tonights dinner, do you think people would watch my chef TV program? Let the ratings decide.
 So no, I guess nothing happened today.
