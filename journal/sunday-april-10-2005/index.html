        <p>I went to one of the best concerts I have ever attended last night. JRod and Cameron sang in the chorus of Mahler&rsquo;s 2nd Symphony. The orchestra was massive. They had 11 horns! Hooray! The off-stage brass effects were really neat. It was a grand night. The music was awesome and the donuts afterwards with good friends was memorable.
 I relaxed today. After two weeks of concentrated music theory followed by two weeks of concentrated biology, I needed a rest. And now, I finally feel relaxed enough to really relax. I fell asleep briefly out on the grass with the light breeze blowing and the sun shining not to hot. It was great. Life is pretty hard, but it&rsquo;s a heap of fun if you have the right attitude.
 This morning in church the pastor said something that really solidified a thought I had floating around in the back of my head. Here is my concentrated statement, you may quote me.
 &ldquo;Humanism has not only deified man, but in the very process of making man supremely significant it has made human life worthless. By denying a creator, humanism has made abortion and euthanasia culturally possible. Thus we have a paradox: life is so important that life is valueless.&rdquo;
