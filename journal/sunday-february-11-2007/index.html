        <p>I can still say I&rsquo;ve never been pulled over by the police.
I was driving home from church tonight and I saw a car turn onto my road at the stop sign just down a little bit. So I swung into my driveway before him with plenty of room. Or so I thought. That is was my driveway, that is. I had pulled into my neighbor&rsquo;s drive. The white SUV drove down and stopped in the road at the foot of the drive. By the way, the drives are only about 20-30 feet long. So I figured it must be them, till I saw the &ldquo;Police&rdquo; written on the door. I was thinking, he must be writing down my number, what for I didn&rsquo;t know: I was reckless, and I didn&rsquo;t know it was a crime to turn in at your neighbor&rsquo;s. Then we walks over shining a flashlight, so I turned the car off and open the door. He asked me my name and then for ID. So I promptly and honestly and non-threateningly answered. Then he said into his mic, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s 50.&rdquo; By the way, I&rsquo;m not 50. He thanked me and left. They were on the lookout for a car like mine since the 50s guy driving it had been in a fight. So I backed out and pulled in at home.
And that&rsquo;s the news. He didn&rsquo;t even ask to smell the vanilla ice cream and chocolate cake on my breath.
