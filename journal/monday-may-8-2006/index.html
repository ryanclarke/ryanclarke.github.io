        <p>Truth is important. I like truth, usually. I like knowing things, and knowing those things are right. But sometimes I see myself, the inside me, and I want to forget the Truth. I want to think that the Truth is not really the truth, and something else is the truth. As Pastor Shoemaker says, &ldquo;People prefer to believe what they prefer to be true.&rdquo; Sometime I just prefer want the truth to make me comfortable. But if truth is really that important, even to the point of Jesus calling Himself &ldquo;the Truth,&rdquo; why do we take such pains to protect ourselves from it. And even if we&rsquo;re honest with the truth to ourselves, why do we try to insulate others from it? Is it some kind of socially acceptable paradox? Modifying a Randy Alcorn quote, why does a Christian from Portland care some much about the delicate psyche of a man from Chicago as they both fly to Philadelphia the he doesn&rsquo;t tell him the Truth? If the Truth be true, we should all be willing to accept, spread, and defend it. I notice this type of adherence to truth is lacking greatly. And it starts with me. I notice that my adherence to truth can be selective. Well, it Truth is true, it&rsquo;s true all the time. May Truth matter to me.
By the way, the seemingly erratic capitalization was somewhat planned.
