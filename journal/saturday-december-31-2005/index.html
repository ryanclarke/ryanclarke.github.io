      <div id="post">
        <p>At the end of 2004 I said that it was the most important year of my life. Now at the end of 2005, I will have to modify that to second place.
 2005 has been the best year yet because of the places I went, the experiences I had, the people I knew, and the things I learned.
 The places I went:
 ~ Pinghu, China - in January through February for 4 weeks
 ~ IBLP Headquarters in Hinsdale, Illinois - in March, June, and September through November for a total of 10 weeks
 ~ Emporia, Kansas - in April for a week
 ~ Holland, Michigan - in May and August for a day each
 ~ Jamestown, Rhode Island and Guilford, Connecticut - in July for a week and a half for family reunions
 ~ Niles, Michigan and Goshen, Indiana - for a weekend for a wedding and overnight at Arlan&rsquo;s house
 ~ Marion, Ohio - in November for a weekend
 ~ Parrish, Florida - in December for a weekend
 The experiences I had:
 ~ Threw up for the first week straight
 ~ Taught English in a foreign country, experienced a different culture, and had a full-scale adventure
 ~ Turned 20
 ~ Went on a cattle drive
 ~ Attended an opera and numerous other concerts
 ~ Composed my Symphony No. 2 in F Major and conducted the premiere with the Verity Chamber Orchestra
 ~ Graduated from Verity
 ~ Visited Chicago several times
 ~ Jumped into Narragansett Bay with my cellphone
 ~ Tutored Harmony
 ~ Became a FedEx shipping expert
 ~ Took music theory classes with Dr. Kincaid
 ~ Created a website with hand-coded HTML: <a href="http://www.ryanclarke.net">www.ryanclarke.net</a>
 ~ Visited (and scaled) the Warren G. Harding Memorial
 ~ Wore a fake bowtie at the Verity Christmas Banquet
 ~ Drove to south Florida and back with my good friend Bryce
 ~ Experienced some honest Christmas awe
 The people I knew:
 ~ My dear family
 ~ The super Verity &lsquo;05 class
 ~ Also the Verity &lsquo;06 class
 ~ The Chinese people, the students, and the teaching assistants, especially Steven, Rachel, and Leo
 ~ The good people at IBLP HQ, especially those in 4008 Adams, John Long and the Carlisle brothers, and also Matt Henton, Willie Antonion, and Mrs. Stern
 ~ The relatives I didn&rsquo;t know I had
 ~ The new Verity &lsquo;07 class
 ~ The Verity Music students
 ~ The close friends God has given to me to strengthen me and help me grow to be like Him, a very short list: my man JRod, and of course Bryce Reckner, Cameron Houser, Josh Strickler, Callie and Sandy Bushatz, Sarah Ness, Teresa Tures, John Apple, Paul Jordan, Laura Cribb, Emily White, and don&rsquo;t forget Micah King
 The things I learned:
 ~ China is a really neat place
 ~ That people have emotions: I entered 2005 as a brain in a body, and left it with a heart, maybe small, but at least it&rsquo;s there; this caused me to rethink my entire philosophy of life and how I relate to people, because the logical answer might hurt their feelings
 ~ That God is bigger than I though
 ~ That the best place I can be is in God&rsquo;s will
 ~ That trusting God is super hard, but it&rsquo;s worth it, God will pull through everytime, I can trust God with my entire life
 ~ Desires and dreams are a good thing if we hold them with an open hand, but that&rsquo;s the trouble
 ~ The best way to grow up, is to become the closest to God that you can
 ~ The &lsquo;more&rsquo; mature you become, the less mature you see that you are
 ~ The list is much to long to fully list (or even remember) right here
 God has been bountifully good to me this year. I am not big into New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions, I try to avoid tying myself to anything that I might break inadvertently, so instead I will set a few goals for the year.
 Goals for 2006:
 ~ I want to give my entire life God, for what every He wants to do through me
 ~ I want to exercise so that when I&rsquo;m 50 I can still rearrange the sofas in my living room
 ~ I want to figure out what specific work(s) God want&rsquo;s me to accomplish with my life
 I thank the Lord for giving me such a wonderful year, and I thank all of you that have had a part in it. Let&rsquo;s enter 2006 with the Lord&rsquo;s help and make it even better!
