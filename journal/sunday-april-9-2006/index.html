        <p>I made it home yesterday around 6:00pm.
I sat around in the Flint airport for 5 hours, which was long. But I did get to break it up some by talking to Lela and Cheri at different times while they waited for their flights (both to Atlanta also). When my flight finally arrived I ended up being the only passenger on the return flight to Atlanta. Welcome to my private jet. The flight attendant gave me two of everything and then once we got to cruising altitude we both stretched out on the seats across the aisle and went to sleep. I chose row 7 so that the emergency exit was handy. When they dumped me off on the concrete at Atlanta there was no one there to welcome me. Actually, the airport didn&rsquo;t even know I was on the plane. So I went scouting down the outside of the terminal to find an open door. I was going in when I met a whole string of people coming out. I guess I found an exit instead of an entrance, oh well. The guards wanted to know why I was there. &ldquo;I got off my plane.&rdquo; &ldquo;Private jet?&rdquo; &ldquo;Basically.&rdquo; So it was quite an adventure.
And now I&rsquo;m home, ready to unpack.
