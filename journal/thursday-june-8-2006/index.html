        <p>God has continued to take care of me.</p>

<p>On Monday, Mom and I flew out to Pheonix, Arizona. We got one of Delta&rsquo;s old Song airplanes, which means one thing: DishNetwork equipped TVs in the back of each headrest! I watched a a documentary on the 3rd Armored Division of the US Army which was really neat, and then an old John Wayne movie where he acts like a jerk and breaks his wife&rsquo;s heart and his own body the entire movie and then at the end when he retires as a legend in the Navy you&rsquo;re supposed to be happy. I wasn&rsquo;t happy - he acted terribly towards his wife - there was no &ldquo;living with her in an understanding way&rdquo; about any of it. And Mom watched the Food Channel (whatever it&rsquo;s called) and took notes. It was pretty funny seeing sitting there with her earbuds in squinting at the little screen taking notes and groaning &ldquo;yum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then we met up with Mrs. Sally Dickason who&rsquo;s a friend of my aunt. She is highly nice. She drove her car with us (we had a rental without cruise control) the entire way to Payson (long way - 100 mi.) and got us settled into the cabin she got worked out with a friend of her&rsquo;s for me to rent, and then drove back to Pheonix that night. So I&rsquo;ve had a place to stay from the first night.</p>

<p>On Tuesday Mom and I went to the plant to use the internet where we discovered the my Dell power cord is broken again, this is the third one I&rsquo;ve had, so we ordered a new one, and then shopped for cars online. Finally we decided to look around in Payson quickly before heading to Pheonix in hopes of finding a car there in the &lsquo;bigger pool.&rsquo; Well, we bumped into this place and they had a lot of expensive cars and then this one cheap one which was a &lsquo;99 Buick Century which was the model Mom thought I should buy. We checked it out and took it for a ride, and let my boss take it for a ride since he&rsquo;s good with cars, and then they gave us an even better deal. So we went back to the plant and I used the phone to sign up for insurance and then I bought it. So now I&rsquo;m a car owner. And get this, God led us to it first off without hardly any looking around! Now I know some of you might think I was hasty (I hope it doesn&rsquo;t fall apart tomorrow!), but I&rsquo;m just trusting God with everything - and He&rsquo;s doing a grand job. So I just spent 3 times more money than I&rsquo;ve ever had at once before in my life. Fortunately Dad had some he could lend me for a little while, so I&rsquo;ll pay him back when it starts to come in with this job.</p>

<p>So after we got the car, Mom said &ldquo;why stick around?&rdquo; so she left on Wednesday. And I&rsquo;ve been working these last two days. I&rsquo;m officially started and on my way to becoming my own person. By the way, I worked 14 hours yesterday (my first day), and I&rsquo;ve been here almost 12 so far today - I hope it levels out to less later! I&rsquo;m just praying that the Lord gives me as much spiritual blessings as He&rsquo;s been giving me physical, monetary, and logistical blessings.</p>

<p>This will be a time where I can think back as say, &ldquo;look at how much the Lord loves me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll send pictures of the cabin and car later when my laptop is running again. Fortunately I have these work computers I can use.</p>
