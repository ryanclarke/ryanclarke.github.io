        <p>I got back home on Saturday night.
 Friday I had passed my macroeconomics test. Then I sat in the Dean of Men&rsquo;s office and answered both phone calls. I also talked with Callie and Mr. Schrader about brain types. Mr. Schrader told my Friday evening that I was Dean of Men until I left. Thus began my <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of a day as Garret.
 I left Saturday at 11 and was home by late afternoon. It is good to be with the family again. Sunday I went to church and saw most of the people I hadn&rsquo;t seen in so long. Monday I went to a string orchestra rehearsal. I just sat in and played along; it was fun. Tuesday morning I completely emptied my computer of all information, transferring the important stuff to another computer, and reinstalled Windows XP. Then in the afternoon I put everything back on it. Today I finished tweaking it back to my preferred settings. I also went shopping for my sister Lydia&rsquo;s birthday.
 Tomorrow is Thanksgiving. I will be flying with my family down to Tampa, FL to visit some family friends who live in Parrish. We fly back home Monday morning. It should be a very fun trip.
 I&rsquo;ll update more later; and I hope it&rsquo;ll be more often.
