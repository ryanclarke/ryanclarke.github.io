        <p>Though not entirely new, this story is fairly recent.
So the UK, not content with having 4.2 million closed circuit cameras filming the normal citizen an average 300 times a day, is upping the crime fighting ploy. They have added speakers to the cameras so that monitoring authorities can scold citizens for &ldquo;anti-social behavior,&rdquo; like littering. Of course it&rsquo;s not all bad, the chiding voices are recordings of friendly children, like that makes me feel better: getting blasted by a 6-year-old. And if getting anonymously reprimanded in public was not enough, they are planning to equip the them with microphones (to detect &ldquo;aggresive tones&rdquo; by pitch, volume, and speed) and lip-reading software (to search for “key words and sentences”) to automatically notify authorities of criminal intent. It gets better, because they are also deploying fully-outfitted, 2-foot, stealth helicopter drones which, through preprogrammed flight plans or remote control, are are able to track down suspicious individuals.
And finally, if you&rsquo;re planning on going to England, go soon. They are preparing to install x-ray to the cameras also. This will help in the dark, and with weapons and explosives detection. Oh, and everyone shows up on the screen naked. We shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, they&rsquo;ve already got cameras in the bathrooms (I can&rsquo;t believe 45% of Britons approved the decision).
All this in spite of a British Government study that found that lighting was more effective in lowering crime than cameras. I say, put in some lights, oh, and return their guns. But please, don&rsquo;t remove my clothes and then yell at me!
