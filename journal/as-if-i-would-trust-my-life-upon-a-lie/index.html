        <p>Religious people are often called people of faith and participate in faith-based activities. In a culture that uses ‘faith’ so prominently and interchangeably with ‘religion’, I think many people are unaware of the Christian concept of faith.</p>

<p>I disagree. Hebrews 11:1 defines faith as “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” Substance and evidence are not terms used to describe a mental handicap. If anything, they are meant to convey a confidence beyond any human will power. Mortimer J. Adler sums it up nicely when he writes, “You must always keep in mind that an article of faith is not something that the faithful ‘assume.’ Faith, for those who have it, is the most certain form of knowledge, not a tentative opinion.” A Christian’s faith transcends belief and rests in solid sureness.</p>

<p>Faith is often confused with belief. Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary gives one definition of faith as “firm belief in something for which there is no proof” and another as “sincerity of intentions.” While it includes other and better definitions, these two demonstrate the perceived weakness of faith in our society.</p>

<p>In a scientific and rational culture, proof and objectivity are regarded as prerequisites for trust in anything of importance. However, these same principles are deemed unimportant in matters of postmodern spirituality where everyone must find their own truth. Faith is simply a belief that the believer holds for comfort, tradition’s sake, or some moral expedient: anything but because it is really true.</p>

<p>I disagree. Hebrews 11:1 defines faith as “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” Substance and evidence are not terms used to describe a mental handicap. If anything, they are meant to convey a confidence beyond any human will power. Mortimer J. Adler sums it up nicely when he writes, “You must always keep in mind that an article of faith is not something that the faithful ‘assume.’ Faith, for those who have it, is the most certain form of knowledge, not a tentative opinion.” A Christian’s faith transcends belief and rests in solid sureness.</p>

<p>Furthermore, faith is described as the substance of a Christian’s hope: heaven. Popularly, hope is often used to express a wish or optimism, but a Christian’s hope is no mere whim if it has a present substance. Heaven and eternal life already exist and Christians currently possess them through the very faith in Christ which is the evidence of these things not seen.</p>

<p>Christianity is not another wish upon a star. I do not stake my life upon Christ because it makes me feel good. I have faith is Christ because He’s true. Faith is my solid assurance in a definite guarantee. As if I would trust my life upon a lie.</p>
