        <p>JRod is back! Classes are over! I&rsquo;m happy. Today I went to a music store. It was really fun to rub shoulders with foriegn musicians. Yep, I taught my last period of English today. I&rsquo;m going to miss some of the kids. I calculate that I named 40 kids in the last two weeks. Pretty wild. The person with the most namings I&rsquo;d ever met before was 11 (large family). I named them after many faimly members and friends. It was fun, and reminded me of home to be calling out brother&rsquo;s and sister&rsquo;s and aunt&rsquo;s names all the time. Tonight I&rsquo;m going out for jou dzu, a really good dish here. Should be fun, and tasty. I&rsquo;ll be catching up with the Ningbo folks who just got back in last night. Tomorrow is church in the morning and then the tour of China bigins in the afternoon. We tour for 4 and a half days and then leave for America on Friday. I can&rsquo;t wait to get back, as hard as it will be to leave. Everything is so new and strange here, it might take awhile to get back to the ordinary. Also, to the fact that everyoine knows everything you&rsquo;re saying. Here, if you talk with big words you&rsquo;re virtually secure in the fact that no chance English speaker with understand a word. Private conversations in public: it&rsquo;s an interesting experience. Well, more later.
