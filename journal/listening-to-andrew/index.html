        <p>Andrew and I went to the dump to dispose of our trash. This is what he said on our road home.</p>

<p>Andrew: Deers are used to the sound of cars but they don&rsquo;t like cars. Isn&rsquo;t that funny? Did you know that if you&rsquo;re covered in spices you won&rsquo;t rot? I was just thinking about that because we drove past the cemetery back there: the one with the dead people. In the old days - I don&rsquo;t think they do it anymore - in the old days they used to bury people in the Pharaoh places. You know, those things. They had hallways and were big. And I was thinking: wouldn&rsquo;t it be funny today if they buried people in one?</p>

<p>Ryan: I think it would be expensive.</p>

<p>Andrew: I guess so.</p>
