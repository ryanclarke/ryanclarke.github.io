        <p>Well, the first week is over and done. I survived. I do miss my afternoon class because they were so nice and good, and cute. And so, I&rsquo;m two days into the last week. My class in the morning is large, 26, but they are good. All are third graders, which means 8 and 9 years old. My teacher assistant (or zou jiao as we say over here) this week is Rachel, a real mai li nu ren. She is about one month older than me. She is a great TA. And the good news: we only teach one class a day! So I&rsquo;m lucky to have a morning class: the whole afternoon and evening is free. Monday afternoon I went out with Rachel, and Jordan and Steven (two non-Verity ATI folks). We went around town and did different things, it was fun. She translated for us, taught us some Chinese, and got us up to speed on different aspects of the Chinese culture. The TAs really want to hang out with us, and it&rsquo;s a lot of fun. It is also a great ministry as sometimes we are able to open up about our faith with them. We try to let Christ&rsquo;s light shine through us.
 Today I had the rare opportunity to be on TV. My first time. I volunteered for an interview with a local Pinghu station. So did Micah, Andrew and some other folks. I turned out to be more than an interview. We had a traditional Chinese New Year&rsquo;s meal on camera. And more than that: we made the meal first. It was great fun. We made and ate Jou Dzu. They roll out these thin. little &lsquo;tortillas&rsquo; and you put some raw, ground pork in the middle with chopsticks. Then you fold the thing in half and crimp it around the edges in a certain way that ensures you will get lots of money in the New Year. The more you make, and the better they look, the more money you with have. I made a lot. But the looked like junk. Oh, but the taste, they were to die for. Very good. They boil them and then you dip them in dark vinegar and eat them whole. I had about 15. They were very good, but I&rsquo;m slightly afraid of getting ill. They were well cooked though. We answered questions. conversed together in English, and thanked the old ladies that served us the meal in their little home in a small alley by a canal. It was agreat experience. New Year&rsquo;s is the 8th! Gong shi! (&ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo;)
