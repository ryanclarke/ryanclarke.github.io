        <p>God was good (again) in 2006.
Blatantly copying my post from last year, I&rsquo;m going to keep the same format. 2006 has been a good year because of the places I went, the experiences I had, the people I knew, and the things I learned.
The places I went:
~ Brevard, North Carolina - week in January
~ Flint, Michigan - January through March
~ Bowdon, Georgia (home) - April and May
~ Monterrey and Torreon, Mexico - week in April
~ Flint again - week in May
~ Nashville, Tennesee - week in June
~ Payson, Arizona - moved here in June
~ Jamestown, Rhode Island and Guilford, Connecticut - week in August
~ San Diego, California - weekend in September
~ Los Angeles, California - weekend in October
~ Bowdon, Georgia - the end of December
~ Seebree, Kentucky - Christmas weekend
The experiences I had:
~ Enjoyed The Wilds Music Conference
~ Heard my Symphony No. 2 in F Major and performed by the Lapeer Civic Orchestra
~ Taught Principles of Harmony 1 &amp; 2 to the Verity &lsquo;07 music class, and had a blast
~ Attended an opera and some other concerts
~ Had the Cameron and Gav Houser and the Bushatz family visit over spring break when Luke got commissioned
~ Spent a week with JRod in Mexico and ate tacos de trompo
~ Saw some good &lsquo;06er friends graduate from Verity
~ Got lost in Nashville looking for a Starbucks instead of going to the ATI student session
~ Took a job as Production Engineer with Pulse Combustion Systems
~ Worked 5 days a week for months on end
~ Stood on top of The Rim - twice
~ Stood under the Tonto Natural Bridge - twice
~ Went to my grandfather&rsquo;s funeral
~ Surfed on Pacific Beach, San Diego
~ Entertained the first guest Faas and I had: Cameron
~ Made omelets with the Dreschers
~ Chaperoned a youth trip to Six Flags in California
~ Celebrated Thanksgiving away from home
~ Redesigned an entire company website
~ Took 3 weeks off to be home for Christmas
The people I knew:
~ My dear family
~ My housemate: Faas
~ My good friends: JRod, Bryce, Cameron, Callie, Sandy, Teresa, Etc, Etc, On and on
~ The Verity &lsquo;07 Music students
~ The Dreschers
~ The good folks at my new church
~ The fun people at work, and especially my boss
The things I learned: (or am learning)
~ Teaching is very hard work, but incredibly fun
~ God can find a job for you when you need one
~ God can find a really good job
~ What it&rsquo;s like to be almost entirely alone for a month and a half
~ What it&rsquo;s like to finally have a housemate
~ How to play tennis
~ How to surf
~ How to be an independent member of society with a car and a house and a job
~ How to be vocal about my Christianity
~ How to live &ldquo;just me and God&rdquo;
~ Compassion (a little)
~ There is a lot that God can teach me from both loneliness and patience
So it&rsquo;s been a very good year and a very different year and a very yearlong year. And looking back, I&rsquo;m happy. Looking forward, I&rsquo;m happy too. I&rsquo;m hoping for good things this year of 2007. There are a lot of things I&rsquo;d like to do and learn and experience. There are also lots of places I&rsquo;d like to go (but I&rsquo;m not expecting much travel this year). We&rsquo;ll see what happens, but I&rsquo;m sure God will be faithful no matter what happens. He has to be.
