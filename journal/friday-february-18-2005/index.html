        <p>Well, I am back with China pictures!
 The last 4 and a half days we toured around to several Chinese cities and saw the notable places there. So, the first thing each morning was a two hour bus ride to the city-of-the-day. And the last feature at night was the bus ride home. Fortunately, the buses were large and comfortable. Blake and I head off for adventure.

 Most of the notable places were rock gardens, beautiful rock gardens. On Monday we went to Suzhou and saw many beautiful sights, including a nice, covered bridge which Callie, Sarah, and I took a rest on.

 The most interesting thing in Suzhou was the old city wall and gate. I love strategic architecture, and this is one point in which Europe and Chinese paralleled each other: in their construction of gates and walls. Sarah, Callie, Sandy, and I ascend the inside access ramp to the old Suzhou city wall while a Chinese man descends.

 Actually, it was a double gate. There was a huge outer gate and a smaller inner gate. In between was courtyard where the enemy could be systematically slaughtered by archers from the surrounding wall. It was a very efficient system. The double gate in the canal worked the same way, except that it destroyed the navy instead of the army. Sarah, Sandy, Callie, and I arrayed accross the opening of the outer gate.

 Inside the courtyard were many ancient Chinese weapons with which we could reenact gruesome performances. The weapons themselves were pretty savage. Take a look at that pencil!

 Callie and I doing A Chinese Gothic. A foriegn take on an American masterpiece. We were still living and thinking like Americans, even in China.

 And a word of advice: don&rsquo;t get a pair of twins mad at you with that many weapons around. What a scary experience, I don&rsquo;t think Callie and Sandy realized it was only supposed to be a photo opportunity!

 Yes, Suzhou was fun city. I would go back there again without hesitation, assuming, of course, that I&rsquo;m ever in the neighborhood again. I&rsquo;ll post pictures of Hangzhou later. Also, many of these picture were not taken by me, I am only using them because I&rsquo;m in them. So, many thanks to Margie, Kendra, and Ben for taking some of these great shots.
