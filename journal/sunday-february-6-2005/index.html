        <p>We all went to the Chinese service at church this morning. My TA from the first week, Steven, and a friend of his, Miller, came also. They&rsquo;d never been to church before, so it was a neat experience for them. Pray for them as they learn more about God. We sang in the service. It Is Well (all 4) and How Great Thou Art (1 &amp; 4). It was neat to hear the Chinese singing and the whole Chinese worship experience. We had communion also. During the prayer I got to thinking, &ldquo;Wow, I can&rsquo;t believe God is getting all that! He&rsquo;s keeping up and knowing what&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo; Then I thought, over the next several hours God will be getting worship services coming up to him in a dazzling array of different tongues. And he knows and understands and answers every prayer. Wow, big God.
 This afternoon we went to Xitang, a famous old Chinese town, sometimes called &ldquo;the Venice of China&rdquo; because of it&rsquo;s many canals. It was pretty neat. We saw a bunch of neat, old stuff. There was this one rock garden in particular that was incredible. It was this huge rock maybe 30 feet round surrounded by water with a little bridge to the rock path along the waters edge if the &lsquo;island.&rsquo; The rock was about 15 feet tall. All cut through the rock were little tunnels to walk through with a few staircases cut through that came out on the top. On top was a pagota style gazebo. It was pretty neat. Put that in the middle of a small pond, get a canoe or two, and you&rsquo;ve got the ultimate boy&rsquo;s paradise. I want one in my back yard. Actually, come to think of it, it was not one rock, but many medium size ones cemented together. Maybe I get one made for my kids (OK, that requires money and kids, which requires a wife. A distant plan.)
 Tonight I went to Mandefu (American-style resturant similar to McDonalds) with Jordan. Then we stopped in for a xiang yu nai cha (Chinese potato flavored milk tea) on the way home. I&rsquo;m going to turn in. Take care all.
