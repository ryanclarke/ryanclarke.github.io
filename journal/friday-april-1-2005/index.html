        <p>This was probably the best April Fools Day I have ever witnessed. And I mean witnessed. It wasn&rsquo;t the jokes I did, but the ones I watched. I didn&rsquo;t do any jokes, but some other people came up with some really good ones.
 Interesting question: Can soemthing you read cause you to let out a real, hearty laugh while simultaneous giving you deep emotional pain? I guess the answer would be yes since Proverbs 14:13 reads, &ldquo;Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.&rdquo; I just don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever had this. But this verse makes me reconsider my idea that laughter means everything is good. It&rsquo;s hard to understand. I was just thinking about these things in relation to this national day of humorous antics.
 &ldquo;Life is a complex mess: sometimes it&rsquo;s worse, othertimes we are asleep.&rdquo; ~someone exactly like me, like me
 And when I said that Minna is very funny I meant it. 她是很有趣的 (tā shì hĕn yŏuqùde) if that makes it easier to understand. I have recieve many questions about that comment. I mean it, I think she is.
