        <p>Regarding the poem from two days ago.
I&rsquo;m not really good at listening to people. Except myself, and even then my attention wanders, as other listeners can probably tell. I am improving in my listening skills, so praise God for that, but I have so much unconscious selfishness in my system that the Lord is really trying to get me to notice other people.
&ldquo;But Lord, I try to listen now.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But Ryan, can you care for people by noticing them.&rdquo;
Do I even see when they are hurting and try to help? Do I get shivers in my spine when someone is excited? Does the realness of another person&rsquo;s life matter to me? Or are they just facts?
I was thinking about all this and I remembered a tough episode about 2 years ago when God really showed me the inside of other people&rsquo;s souls by exposing my own. That was when I wrote the poem.
And now I&rsquo;m just doing some &ldquo;sanctification for dear life.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s really had me on a growth routine this last year.
