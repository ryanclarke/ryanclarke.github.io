        <p>The Lake Powell Adventure - Extended Edition
Lake Powell on the Colorado River is the second largest man-made lake in the world (after Lake Mead downstream) but it has by far the largest water volume because it&rsquo;s basically Glen Canyon filled with water. In fact, the sides of the lake are so steep in most places that there are only 6 marinas in the entire 1,900 miles of shoreline. When it was finished back in 1966 it took 17 years to fill up. Right now it&rsquo;s only about 60% full.
We stayed at the Wahweap, AZ marina area right near the Glen Canyon Dam.

You can see our campsite in this picture along with our church bus and the lake in the background.

The lake looked beautiful from the top of the hill during sunrise.

In this picture you can see the &ldquo;cove&rdquo; where we spent the day swimming. We used Pastor Allen&rsquo;s Dad&rsquo;s boat to get over there. I say cove because this protrusion of water usually connects with the water under the cliffs in the background making our sandy beach normally under many feet of water as you can tell from the obvious &ldquo;bathtub&rdquo; ring.

On Friday I drove up to the Navajo Nation to meet up with the youth group where they had been doing a VBS at a local church all week. As I was driving along Saint Mary&rsquo;s Lake Road keeping myself entertained with songs and jokes I started sing &ldquo;Over the Rainbow.&rdquo; I just reached the part when it goes, &ldquo;Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly&hellip;&rdquo; when a bird of some type headbutted my front grill. I guess that&rsquo;s one way to go over the rainbow.
After meeting the youth in Gray Mountain we traveled by church bus up to Wahweap where we pulled out the tents and realized that we didn&rsquo;t have space for everyone. A lot of the guys opted to sleep under the stars because it seemed exciting. I ended up getting a spot in a tent, which was good because I didn&rsquo;t have a sleeping bag. I&rsquo;m not very practiced of late with the me-and-the-dirt style of sleeping, so the night didn&rsquo;t go so well. The dirt won.
The lady who normally comes on these trip and cooks wasn&rsquo;t able to to make it, and her daughter who ended up planning the meals got sick and went home before the Lake Powell portion, so the meals fell to Ben and I. So we woke up on Saturday morning and went to cook the pancakes (from mix, fortunately!) with: no mixing bowl, no measuring cups, no spatula. It was interesting. We borrowed a metal fork so we had something non-melting to flip with, we measured the water with a pint bottle and the mix with a 10oz cup and stirred in a coffeepot. The bacon had to be placed in a coffee cup since the sizzling strips were melting the styrofoam plates. We also didn&rsquo;t think and cooked the bacon first, so the first few pancakes were saturated in bacon grease, which was pretty gross, but Jess liked them, so whatever floats his boat. But everyone enjoyed the meal (I hope) and we headed off to the lake.
I remembered to put on sunscreen and hardly got burned at all except a little on my forehead. But Steven didn&rsquo;t put on a drop and ended the day past red, past brown, to deep gray, like charcoal. The rocks around our cove were sandstone, which is really gritty so it makes it easy to climb up the fairly steep &lsquo;cliffs&rsquo; which dropped deep into the water. However, if you clung to one spot too long the sandstone turned to a slimy sand and send you sliding back into the water. So we had a good day and were totally tired by evening when we went by the local resort and relaxed by dashing madly between the hot tub and cold pool. We didn&rsquo;t bother anyone with our antics because they all left when it started to storm out in the distance. But there&rsquo;s nothing like repeatedly shocking the core of your system under a gathering canopy with some mood lightning.
Then we went to sleep and most of the guys slept in the but because the sand wasn&rsquo;t looking goodunder the monsoon. I ended up being &ldquo;houseleader&rdquo; of the bus, while Pastor Allen took the tented guys and his sister Nita took the girls. The armrests in the bus don&rsquo;t fold up so I had to fit my entire torso onto two seats. My head and torso are 3 inches too long. and I had one leg under the armrests and one leg over, and it was numb in two places all night.
Then we all woke up for more pancakes and bacon. It went a lot better because Mr. Benkert had gone over the dam to Page, AZ because it&rsquo;s a big enough city to have a Wal*Mart and he bought measuring cups, spatulas, and ladels. Also, we had some girls make the food. They claimed it was all them, but of course, Ben and I know better that it was really just the superior equipment they had. But they were smart enough to do the pancakes first, so I will give them (and their moms) some credit for knowing these elusive secrets to successful meals.
And we drove back on Sunday. I sat on the front seat of the bus so I could talk to Pastor Allen and enjoy the panorama the large windows afforded. The downside was that I was right under the air conditioning unit which was dripping on me every 10-12 seconds, like a multi-decade Chinese water torture regimen. I took some pictures but I won&rsquo;t post them here because they are so disappointing (not like the first ones were spectacular either, but I had to show something). The Great American West is so huge and rugged that you have to see it to understand.
And we got home and I took a shower and then slept for 10 and a half hours so I&rsquo;d be ready for work. It was a very fun trip and I hope that some of the little conversations I had with the various kids will help support what Pastor Allen is teaching them and will help them follow Christ all the more as they go through these formative years.
