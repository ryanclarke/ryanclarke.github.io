        <p>Three things:
HAPPY MOTHER&rsquo;S DAY MOM!!! She is the best mom ever. No other person (except maybe Dad) has done so much for me and bears so much credit for where I am today. And that&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve made it till today. I love her.
I got my degree audit in from TESC yesterday. I HAVE 120 CREDITS! I&rsquo;m done with my degree. No all I have to do is wait till the next graduation to get my actually paper to hang on the wall. That&rsquo;s in September, so you all have another 4 months before you have to look at a low-res scan of my diploma
Jonathan Eddy and Rachel Winsted are now officially one flesh. They had a lovely wedding yesterday afternoon and a celebratory reception. It was great to see all the Verity folks there. So many I hadn&rsquo;t seen in ages. We got a picture with ever Verity person at the wedding. These folks span the entire history of the school. With the happy, new couple in the center. See if you can&rsquo;t pick out the other six couples in the picture (at least, the ones I know about).Good times!

Garret will thank me for not posting another wedding picture I have.
