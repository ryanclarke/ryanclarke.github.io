      <h1 class="title">The Fable of Simon McDarpet</h1>
      
      <div id="post">
        <p>I give you the fable of Simon McDarpet,<br />
A boy, it would seem, with a hatred for carpet;<br />
And tables, of course, and most anything wooden<br />
And things that get hurt when you act like you shouldn’t,<br />
And all sorts of rugs, also windows and doors.<br />
But your guess would be right if you singled out floors.<br />
You’d be right on the money—the wad that was spent—<br />
On repairing the issues he could have prevent-<br />
ed because of the sloshing of liquids he did,<br />
All because he refused to seal drinks with a lid.</p>

<p>And don’t get me started on all of the chow<br />
That was strewn down the hall in the wake of that cow.<br />
Steaming heaps of lasagna and well-buttered biscuits,<br />
Potatoes with herbs that were creamed with a wisk—it’s<br />
A shame—and I know of the groans in my belly,<br />
Surveying the wasted baked oatmeal and jelly.<br />
However the groans that were felt in the gut<br />
Of another man spying the path to the mutt<br />
(Like a humanoid snail or a monstrous slug<br />
Who was leaving a trail of wet smears on the rug);<br />
These were groans that could make a man wither in fear<br />
And concurrently make that same man shed a tear,<br />
As poor Curtis would go fetch the tools of his trade,<br />
For the treasure of kingdoms could scarcely have paid<br />
For the hours he spent grimly cleaning the carpet<br />
Of stains that were left by that Simon McDarpet.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll remember, dear cleanliness lover,<br />
To never move food without using a cover.</p>
