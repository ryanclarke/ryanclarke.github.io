I drove into Atlanta with Mom tonight. We ate dinner at the Varsity with Ben and gave him his basketball pep band t-shirt.
 So my sisters decided to melt down old candles and make new ones. Good idea. I just hoped they washed the pots, because waxy food doesn't excite me.
 I think I left my camera's download cable in Flint.
 So I am finished with 6 books so far. Christian books. I'm normally not a Christian book reader. I read literature or information books, but all my Christian reading is from the Bible. So this is really good. I'm getting some good perspectives from people who've been Christians a lot longer than me. Very good stuff. And I'm adding to the 'to read' stack faster than the 'have read' stack. Looks like a busy winter!
