The last few days have not been very full. But yet it seems like I kept fairly busy, looking back. I guess that's how it is: time expands to fill it's allotted space.
 I think I am done with all my personal Christmas preparations. I take that back: according to my calculations, I am done with my personal Christmas preparations. However, I think I am not done because I'm probably forgetting something. Oh well, I just hope I remember before long - or I hope it's not important.
 My little brother and sister can finally count the days until Christmas on one hand.
 I recommend everyone read db8er4ever's article: [They Call Him Santa](http://www.xanga.com/db8er4ever/410089307/item.html).
