God is so good. It just amazes me that we can ask Him for things and He actually gives them to us. We don't even have to have it "all together."
So I've been asking God to use me (see Wednesday's post). Sort of generic maybe, but I want to use my faith, not just sit on it and watch it grow like a retirement fund (hopefully) does.Â  On Wednesday Faas and I met this nice girl who works at Fireside Espresso. She's a Christian and goes to Ponderosa Baptist, the church Faas and I attend. She invited us to the youth group, so we went tonight and had a great time. So, just two days after we really started asking God for a ministry, He sends us an opportunity in the form of Nneka (that's her correct spelling). Maybe we can start a coffee shop ministry. With some youth ministry at Ponderosa on the side. I'm just keeping my eyes open.
It might not seem so in writing, but God has made this an exciting weekend in several ways.
Back to work tomorrow!
Ryan
