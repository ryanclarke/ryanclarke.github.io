I was soaked to the bone yesterday. My socks were soaked to the bone too. They talk about this "dry heat" here in Arizona - well it's not hot when you're soaked.
I cleaned the dryer out after running this nasty stuff they feed chickens. I was hunched inside the bathysphere (the baghouse) spraying the hose full force at the walls and the walls were spraying the water full force back at me. My safety glasses were so wet that the whole world looked like a melting ice sculpture. I was drowning in my dust mask. It was cold and slippery.
Sometimes it feels good to go postal with a hose. Everything is shiny now.
I got my high-speed cable internet working. So I will be more easy to reach now. If you want to reach me.
