Faas and I are off on an adventure.Â  We're going as chaperons with our church's youth group to Magic Mountain Theme Park and then the beach on Sunday. We leave at 8:30pm tonight an get back about midnight on Sunday. It should be an experience. Fun, and I hope growing. I want to get to speak to some of the kids about important things. We'll see.
Till Monday.
Ryan
