God was good (again) in 2006.
Blatantly copying my post from last year, I'm going to keep the same format. 2006 has been a good year because of the places I went, the experiences I had, the people I knew, and the things I learned.
The places I went:
\~ Brevard, North Carolina - week in January
\~ Flint, Michigan - January through March
\~ Bowdon, Georgia (home) - April and May
\~ Monterrey and Torreon, Mexico - week in April
\~ Flint again - week in May
\~ Nashville, Tennesee - week in June
\~ Payson, Arizona - moved here in June
\~ Jamestown, Rhode Island and Guilford, Connecticut - week in August
\~ San Diego, California - weekend in September
\~ Los Angeles, California - weekend in October
\~ Bowdon, Georgia - the end of December
\~ Seebree, Kentucky - Christmas weekend
The experiences I had:
\~ Enjoyed The Wilds Music Conference
\~ Heard my Symphony No. 2 in F Major and performed by the Lapeer Civic Orchestra
\~ Taught Principles of Harmony 1 & 2 to the Verity '07 music class, and had a blast
\~ Attended an opera and some other concerts
\~ Had the Cameron and Gav Houser and the Bushatz family visit over spring break when Luke got commissioned
\~ Spent a week with JRod in Mexico and ate tacos de trompo
\~ Saw some good '06er friends graduate from Verity
\~ Got lost in Nashville looking for a Starbucks instead of going to the ATI student session
\~ Took a job as Production Engineer with Pulse Combustion Systems
\~ Worked 5 days a week for months on end
\~ Stood on top of The Rim - twice
\~ Stood under the Tonto Natural Bridge - twice
\~ Went to my grandfather's funeral
\~ Surfed on Pacific Beach, San Diego
\~ Entertained the first guest Faas and I had: Cameron
\~ Made omelets with the Dreschers
\~ Chaperoned a youth trip to Six Flags in California
\~ Celebrated Thanksgiving away from home
\~ Redesigned an entire company website
\~ Took 3 weeks off to be home for Christmas
The people I knew:
\~ My dear family
\~ My housemate: Faas
\~ My good friends: JRod, Bryce, Cameron, Callie, Sandy, Teresa, Etc, Etc, On and on
\~ The Verity '07 Music students
\~ The Dreschers
\~ The good folks at my new church
\~ The fun people at work, and especially my boss
The things I learned: (or am learning)
\~ Teaching is very hard work, but incredibly fun
\~ God can find a job for you when you need one
\~ God can find a really good job
\~ What it's like to be almost entirely alone for a month and a half
\~ What it's like to finally have a housemate
\~ How to play tennis
\~ How to surf
\~ How to be an independent member of society with a car and a house and a job
\~ How to be vocal about my Christianity
\~ How to live "just me and God"
\~ Compassion (a little)
\~ There is a lot that God can teach me from both loneliness and patience
So it's been a very good year and a very different year and a very yearlong year. And looking back, I'm happy. Looking forward, I'm happy too. I'm hoping for good things this year of 2007. There are a lot of things I'd like to do and learn and experience. There are also lots of places I'd like to go (but I'm not expecting much travel this year). We'll see what happens, but I'm sure God will be faithful no matter what happens. He has to be.
