I love being a Christian. And sometimes for odd reasons. I feel tonight like I have a head start on the entire world. I mean, I believe in a God who says "behold I tell you a mystery" and "truly, truly, I say unto you" and "if any man lack wisdom let him ask of God who gives to all men freely." Truth gives you such an awfully large advantage in understanding everything.
Not that we know everything, but at least we know the One who does!
