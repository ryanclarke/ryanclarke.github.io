I had some Mexican food today. It was nowhere near the best Mexican food I've tasted, if you catch my drift. Or the least expensive. But it has the longest aftertaste, if you catch that drift. Especially when you consider the hiccups I had a few hours later. I should eat an ice cream sandwich or something. OK, I will. I think I'll drift into the kitchen.
