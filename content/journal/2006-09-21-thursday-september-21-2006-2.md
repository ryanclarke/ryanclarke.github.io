Today was a not-good day.
It all started with the interrogation by the KGB for tax evasion. And there was that weird half-soviet secretary in the corner who was scaring me to pieces.
Then I woke up tired.
Several hours of scratching little crumbs of yeast powder off the inside of 4 inch stainless steel pipes.
Failed attempt at a nap during lunch break.
All afternoon packaging rosemary powder as I stood right next to a huge, loud, vibrating cyclone. As I got a worse and worse headache coupled with nausea, dizziness, and decreasing desire to live.
Then I lightly tapped on this little glass window into the cyclone and it shattered. So you can't leave the glass shards in the food stuff, so we took apart the cyclone and completely cleaned it of powder and quarantined the contaminated bucket. About this time I was feeling awful and the pizza arrived. I called Mom and told how I was doing (very bad) and she prayed for me.
30 minutes later I was feeling better. God is so amazing. But I think I learned my lesson. I had been harboring some critical attitudes towards my boss for some mistakes I had judged he made. But God showed me quick that I'm not superman. I can make mistakes too. And get sick. My boss was so forgiving during all the mess I made and he even order us three pizza for dinner (the third would be Faas).
But it wasn't over. Because we had to clean out the chamber but the double dumps had their timing off creating all these weird problems with airflow. After trying everything we turned the other air compressor on and they started working right again.
Then we had to scrape all the crusty stuff out of the pipes and then package up the remaining powder.
We finally made it out of there at 11PM. So I've beaten my endurance record and set a new one of a 15-hour workday. It was crazy.
There was some good hidden in all the hardship, but I would be happy to never repeat today. Moral of the day: forgive others of their perceived faults because you have real ones of your own.
Tomorrow we don't have to go in till noon. I'm going to sleep in... and no KGB thank you.

Morning edit:
In case I didn't make myself clear, I like my job. I also like my boss. I really like my life as it is right now. Just sometimes things combine in such a way that portions are unpleasant. Yesterday afternoon and evening was one of those times. I really think that it was more than just a 'bad day' but really God trying to show me some things, hence the moral above. I hope none of you thought that I was pointing at the job or my boss as the problem: the problem was me. I had a good night sleep and I feel alive this morning.
