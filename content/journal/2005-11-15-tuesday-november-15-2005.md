You might not believe how hard it is around here to find large, sound, cardboard boxes. The kitchen gets some and promptly destroys them and puts them in bin out on the loading dock. It's not safe to go out there without a gasmask on. So I've found some, but not enough to cram all my stuff into. I'm on the verge of throwing it all away: having stuff is too much trouble. But that wouldn't be prudent.
 I feel like a shallow materialist. But why? Because I have some stuff? Even Jesus had stuff. I pray that my focus would not be on my stuff and all other things that are temporary, but that I'll focus wholly on the Lord.
