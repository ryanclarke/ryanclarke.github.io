The weather here included big winds. I was thinking that it was a fairly breezy morning, but the guys at work said there would be gusts up to 50 mph. By afternoon I believed them. Well, it's good to get the air changed around here every so often.
They say you learn something new every day. Today I learned that the Speaker of the British House of Commons isn't actually allowed to speak. How odd. He's more of the policeman who picks the next person to speak, enforces House rules, and stops runaway debates, all the while being strictly non-partisan and never voting (except non-partisanly during a tie). Who ever heard of a silent speaker? How about "Listener of the House of Commons."
