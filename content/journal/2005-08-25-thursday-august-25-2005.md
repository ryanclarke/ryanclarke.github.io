Am I a friend to someone because I like them and like being their friend? Or because they need me and I can help them? Can I be a true friend for selfish reasons? Or does true friendship require love, which 1 Corinthians 13:5 says *"seeketh not her own"*? Maybe true friendship is a two-way thing: both give, both recieve. I thank the Lord for the true friends He has given me, and I pray that I can become a better friend to them as well.
