I'm back home!
I flew through Seattle to Phoenix. Mount Ranier is HUGE! We flew just to the west of it, so I could look straight down on the summit.
Business travel is not all glamorous. It's tiring and a lot of work. But I'm home and I have one thing on my mind: a headache. And I need rest.
Life is exciting and a whole lot like an unfinished story. Oh, that's right, it IS an unfinished story.
