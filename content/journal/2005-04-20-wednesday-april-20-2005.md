I conducted my composition today at rehearsal. It is the first one at which I have stood in front. Wow. I love it. Hearing a live group perform my music is about the best feeling in the world. I don't think I've ever felt better than after working with those fine folks this evening. I can't wait till the concert: I will be in a paradise-like state.
 In other news, today I celebrated the man who contributed more to life that we know. In fact, we don't know. We don't know at all. That man was [Wilhelm Schwartzwald](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v300/classicalRyan/WilhelmSchwartzwald.jpg).
