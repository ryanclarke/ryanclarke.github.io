I saw Herbie again and I still haven't managed to take a picture. Yeah, he lives in my town.

I played a little paintball today and I'm happy to report that my gun, with it's new low-pressure mod (that I finally completed), performed admirably and I'm quite happy with the improvement. Not that you care, but you might be interested to know that I shot about 5 balls into the trunk of my car by mistake. Fortunately I hit some other paintball stuff in there so my fine gray carpet (I guess that what you call it) is not a mysteriously tie-dyed design like I had feared. "Fear" is probably a harsher term than necessary for my peculiar emotion: "surprised 'huh'-ness" would be a more exact term. I'm just glad it didn't happen to Herbie. Needless to say, since I was the winner of that little duel it had to carry me home.

I took the final test for my evangelism training class. It was a very long handwritten test. By the end of it I was so cramped that my handwriting was changing styles faster than women's clothing. It didn't help that I keenly felt the pressure of time.

Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow and my cold will be gone. Wouldn't that be exciting!
