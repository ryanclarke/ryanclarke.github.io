I am leaving Verity forever within an hour. Very sad. I'll be home by the afternoon.
My room is bare, except for Cameron's things. Everything is packed. I am officially moved out.
Almost no one is here. There is no one to say goodbye to. They have almost all left already.
I am leaving the familiar life I've had, and I'm venturing out into my unknown future. Unknown to all but God.
And so I say goodbye to my home, for that is what it has become these last 2 years.
Goodbye.
Ryan
