Three years ago today I arrived at Verity. The start of an adventure. I saw for the first time many people who would become good friends.
Regarding my purchase of Vista. I realize that there will be so issues with the new software over the next months and year. I was actually not planning to buy it for a while, but I figured that if I bought it now I could play around with it some, and use it more and more as my primary OS as it becomes more stabilized. If I buy it now I can still use it later, if I buy it later I can't use it now. It's not like I'm wasting use-time: they're going to continue supporting it till January 2017. I'll tell you all how awesome it is in a few days.
And Payson was covered, once again, in snow. The fog today (all day) was white, not gray. You couldn't see the mountains. "Somebody stole The Rim!" It was pretty neat. Like living in jug of milk.
