For some reason it seemed like a slow weekend. I mean, really slow. I feel like I was bored to death all weekend. Which is weird because of all the really fun stuff I did.
 I went to a nature preserve on Saturday morning. Fun stuff.
 Went to Red Robin twice for 4 birthday parties. Bottomless fries are awesome, as well as a good marketing technique.
 I won my first game of pingpong against a guy. Everyone else I've ever beaten has been female. Go figure. I've only won against about 5 different people anyway. So maybe I'm improving. Hopefully I'll have a little more time to play in the next few weeks, because it's a really fun game.
