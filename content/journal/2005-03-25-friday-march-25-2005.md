My computer broke. I think it has something to do with the power plug on the back of the computer because it works fine off batteries, but when I plug the power cord into it I don't get any electricity. It is a very sad problem. That is why I'm using JRod's computer right now.
 Today is the last day of music theory. This morning the two Texas girls, Laura and Kristin, are taking their Counterpoint final test. Meanwhile, JRod, Minna, Charissa, and I will be doing the last bit of studying to prepare us for the Form & Analysis Phase II test. Both of these tests are very hard, so pray for us if you think about it. Thank you.
 And my the Lord give you a day free of chromactic harmonies. So that there are more left for us.
 Ryan
