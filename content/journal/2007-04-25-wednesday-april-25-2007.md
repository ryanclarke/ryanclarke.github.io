Is 100 a big number?
My boss is always telling me, "Sell a dryer, Ryan. Sell a dryer." So I called up this guy while I was at work today and told him all about our company and listened to him talk all about his. And he's really excited and now our president is really excited and it looks like we might get to work with these folks and end up selling a ton of dryers to them and their customers.
100 day are soon gone. 100 dollars are soon spent. 100 words are soon said. But 100 dryers?! I hope this deal works out because then I'm the hero. Whoop, whoop, yay.
Maybe 100 is a big number after all...

By the way, the plane tickets are bought for my excursion to Verity Grad '07 and Jerica's Party. See you there!
