I had an image flash through my head today. A secluded meadow awash in a liquid moonlit fading back into a rich, warm blanket of swaying leaves. I wish I could have take a picture. I wish I could have sat on the slight knoll and wordlessly watched the peace.
Instead I rinsed off the shampoo that had formed rivulets down my face. Why do showers seem to generate artistic creativity? Does the feeling of seclusion inspire all those vocal techniques being emitted from bathrooms across the country every day? Just a thought.
\*edit for Del:\* I said "the feeling of seclusion." Maybe I should have said "the illusion of aural seclusion." Then again, back to my original thought, maybe showering people just don't care if anyone hears them singing "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot." Because face it, people hear you, loud and clear.
