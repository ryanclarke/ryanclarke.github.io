I got to help out with the Katrina relief effort!
 This Christian guy called Mr. Schrader and asked if we could help him prepare a place nearby to recieve some hurricaine victims. So we cleaned out this storage building and set up beds and food supplies and clothes. It wasn't very much, really, in the whole big work. But it was a very good opportunity for me to put my body where my heart and mouth were. I believe people, especially Christians, should be eager to help a world in need. But here I am so far the need and with no money. But then this opportunity came to do something. I'll never know who I helped, and they'll never know me, but I hope that they are blessed by my small service.
 Thanks to all the other Verity folks who came, and helped make the work fun.
 Ryan
