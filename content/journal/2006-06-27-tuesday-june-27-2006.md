The internet in Payson has been turned off all day. Who ever heard of town-wide, day-time curfew.
Faas is saying lots of words that I think mean "Hi."
We did more experimenting today on venturi shapes for the dryer. Faas and I could have blended in with the local senior population with all the white maltodextrin powder in our hair.
We got a tour of The Vicarage. I looks like we'll be renting it and the attached guardhouse. More details later.
And so for a second night the boss (for Faas the future new boss) is buying dinner. Maybe more steak?
