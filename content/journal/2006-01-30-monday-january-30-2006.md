Today I went with my family to Frankenmuth, MI. It was cold, but we had a great time. I'm going to miss my family these next two months while I'm at school: my last two golden months at Verity.
We stopped in this one little shop in Frankenmuth that sold tons of junk including little pocket knives with different names carved in the wooden handles. Of course my 6-year-old brother Andrew wanted one, so he showed it to Mom. It said "Harry." So he picked another: it read "Guy."
At Taco Bell he was having trouble eating his bean burrito as it fell apart. "It's dissecting itself! It's like eating a frog."
He's a great brother, and funny too.
