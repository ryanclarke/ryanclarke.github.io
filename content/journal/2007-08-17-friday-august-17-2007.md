I'm now halfway through this day, this day that I am 22½ years old. Woohoo for me!
Today is the start of the World's Oldest Continuous Rodeo here in Payson. Actually, it's the World's Oldest Rodeo too, but Prescott, AZ copywrited that title (unjustly). So yes, our rodeo is older AND has been held every year. Take THAT, Prescott!
By the way, did you know that the CD (Compact Disk) turned 25 today. 25!?!?! The first one came off the production line this date in 1982. Since that time over 200 billion have been made. I think that 150 billion of them were probably those ever-present AOL signup disks. So CDs are officially 2½ years older than me.
