Well isn't this nifty thing slick? For those of you who actually have a xanga and post, The Xanga People have given us a new text and photo editor with a glistening interface and longer load time for dial-up. What a surprise! I like it, especially the new word count feature in the bottom right corner.
Do any of you get the feeling at times in your life that you're just waiting for something to happen? And do you sometimes get the feeling when something does finally happen it was just a doorway into another round of waiting? And in the midst of it all you have to find something to do, some way to keep moving forward? Some way to avoid wasting your life while you're waiting for it to move? Well, if you do get those feelings, I'm sorry. I'm getting to the point where I'm starting to feel your pain. I think I'm stepping into round two of patience training.
But the good news is that waiting finally ends. Praise the Lord. And as a sign, I just received my \$50 rebate back today after a month and a half of 'processing' (literal meaning: waiting, as on a desk or in a stack).
