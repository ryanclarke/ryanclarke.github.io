Photopost on Cameron's day in Payson with "us."
We picked Cameron up in Phoenix about 4 on Sunday. We ate at this Arby's that had a electronic kiosk checkout. It was crazy. People are much fast than that machine. We stopped by the coffeeshop on the way into town just to give him some local feel. Then we hung around and talked in the evening.
We took him to our church in the morning and introduced him to all the little youth friends we have. We took him to Macky's of course afterwards. I happened to order the same thing as Cameron which disturbed him greatly. For some reason. Then we hit the trail to Tonto Natural Bridge. As we walked down the familiar (to Faas and I) canyon, Cameron discovered that one of the little caves had a hole leading up in the back. So of course we climbed it. It lead to another cave and another cave and another cave all the way up the side of the canyon. Here's a picture I took of the canyon through a hole.

Cameron waved from a ledge on the canyon wall as I took his picture from the next hole in the cliff.

As you can see the rock is really porous and rough and is great for climbing. It was so fun we had to curb some of Faas's excitement before a ranger curbed it for him.

Then we climbed the other canyon wall. It was not nearly as easy, but we did manage to get up halfway. Here Cameron points to the caves we traversed on the north face. When I say "caves" I really mean air pockets in the limestone.

Cameron discovered this nifty view of the little swimming hole under the bridge. Sign: "No swimming allowed." We wonder if tubing is permitted.

Here's a brief video of me sliding down this perfect rock. Bummer about the no swimming.
After enjoy the life out of the Tonto bridge we headed up to the vistas available on the Rim. Here's a picture from our overlook.

Afterwards we showed Cameron our workplace and then drove down to Phoenix where we ate a very long dinner at Uncle Sam's and then met up with Jen Drescher and talked until late at night at a Starbucks.
It was an awesome weekend! Anyone else looking for a fun and adventure and fellowship and memories? Come to Payson!
