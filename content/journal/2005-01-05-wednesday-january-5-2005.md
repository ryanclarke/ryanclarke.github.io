And the news is... I'll probably live. I'm still feeling off, but the fever is down to about 99.1 degrees, not bad. But for some reason I still feel awful. Ester-C works. My brother Ben went to the store and got some yesterday and not 6 hours after I took the first pill the fever died out. Remember to take your Ester-C. The last few days I've been watching those boring girl movies like Emma and Pride and Prejudice. Actually, they're perfect for a fever because if I step out to get some pills or something I don't miss anything. And they don't get my pulse going so that it agrivates my headache. And the camera angle changes so infequently that I can rest my eyes if I need to. Actually, they were enjoyable. But the illness is not.
