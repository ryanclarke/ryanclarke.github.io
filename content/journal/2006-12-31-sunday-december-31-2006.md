Our internet was out for a few days. Ben and I just got it working again just a little while ago. Because of this, my annual Thank The Lord For A Good Year Post will be a little delayed. Church people will be arriving in a few minutes for a party. Tomorrow about noon I leave and I'll be back in Payson tomorrow night. My holiday is basically over, and it's been a good one. So in short,
Happy New Year!
Ryan
