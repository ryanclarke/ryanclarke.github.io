So another weekend draws to a close. I'm so glad God knew we'd need some periodic time off and built it into His system.
I got to talk to by brother Andrew (newly 7) today on the phone. He's learning how to play chess from Dad. I quizzed him on the pieces and he knew all their names and how they moved and everything. I was impressed. "My Dad, I mean Dad, is teaching me chess, but he always does checkers, \*Mom's voice mumbling in background\* I mean check. Then he wins. My Mom, I mean Mom, was just telling me something." I understand, Andrew.
On a personal note, Faas is more awesome than even Woodrow Wilson. I just wanted that to go on record as my official opinion.
