Home is good.
 I went shopping with Mom today. I don't really like shopping when I can't haggle or pay in yuan. But it wasn't so bad, we were looking at electronics. And I was with my Mom. So we talked. And talked some more. I have so much to talk about with my Mom after being away for so long, and going to China. Stuff that I forget to say on the phone, or don't think to talk about till we're looking at each other. I don't know, I guess I'd have to say that Moms are one of the best things in life. And Chick-fil-A. If they had one of those in the U of M Pavillion, I'd be broke.
 I guess quite a few little things have happened in Flint since I left two days ago. Oh well, I'm always missing something somewhere. In economic terms: opportunity cost. I've never been in a snowstorm before. Eight inches in one night I hear, wow.
 I'm coming back tomorrow. I will arrive at the RCI between 2:00 and 2:10 pm. If a welcome party would like to assemble to greet me back to the white north, that would be the time. If no one shows up, I'll track you down. Well, I'll probably just say hi at dinner. That'll work. Can't wait to see you all.
 Ryan
