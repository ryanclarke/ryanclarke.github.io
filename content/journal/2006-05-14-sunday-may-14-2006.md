Three things:
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY MOM!!! She is the best mom ever. No other person (except maybe Dad) has done so much for me and bears so much credit for where I am today. And that' I've made it till today. I love her.
I got my degree audit in from TESC yesterday. I HAVE 120 CREDITS! I'm done with my degree. No all I have to do is wait till the next graduation to get my actually paper to hang on the wall. That's in September, so you all have another 4 months before you have to look at a low-res scan of my diploma
Jonathan Eddy and Rachel Winsted are now officially one flesh. They had a lovely wedding yesterday afternoon and a celebratory reception. It was great to see all the Verity folks there. So many I hadn't seen in ages. We got a picture with ever Verity person at the wedding. These folks span the entire history of the school. With the happy, new couple in the center. See if you can't pick out the other six couples in the picture (at least, the ones I know about).Good times!

Garret will thank me for not posting another wedding picture I have.
