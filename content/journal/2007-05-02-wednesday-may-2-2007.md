I smelled worse than a deodorant commercial.
After nearly 11 hours in a plastic suit I was pretty awful. We were running some stuff that had a corrosive ingredient, so I got on the full suit, the full mask, and the big gloves. I tell you, when it's already really hot, you don't want unbreathable clothing. And in dingy red lighting, no less. It was a interesting day to say the least. Only one more like it before life returns to normal.
Related question: Do you dislike smelling bad because it's embarrassing to you, or offensive to others? It's kind of convicting if we realize that so many of the 'nice' things we do are really selfish in motivation.
