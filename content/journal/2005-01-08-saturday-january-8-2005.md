Isn't it great when something you're doing comes off easy, when the work seems to do itself? I love it. This happened for me this morning when the piece I decided to write flowed effortlessly onto Finale, the world's most powerful music notation software. Now I have only two more pieces to write!
 And I'm feeling better. I had a clunking headache this morning, but it's gone now, thanks to some pills. I guess I'm about ready to return to the RCI tomorrow. At least, I'm probably returning there tomorrow, maybe Monday if I'm to sick, but I doubt it.
 When I woke up, there was a purple VW Bug outside my window. Quite peculiar. Yep, there it still sits. And it's still purple. By the way, how come cars can be running when they're sitting still, while when Mom says "Go run" I can't stay sitting still? Hmm, vexing.
