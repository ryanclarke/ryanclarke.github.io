In other news, I take the final test for Form & Analysis III today at 1:00pm.Â  So do Minna and JRod. We feel ready because Dr. Kincaid is such an awesome teacher. At 10:00am the three of us are going to get to together for one last study session. So, I guess I might post later today to tell if I passed. In what would be my first ever double-post day. We'll see. I hope we get high scores!
