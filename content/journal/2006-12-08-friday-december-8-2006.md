So that guy Joe who I've talked to several times at the coffeeshop, well, I didn't go today. But Faas went down to Fireside Espresso and Joe started asking him all sorts of questions about the Bible. So that would be the first time he's ever given a thought to if it's credible. He also asked about joining a men's Bible study. This is amazing news. Praise the Lord!
