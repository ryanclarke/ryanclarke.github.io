Well, I finished up the job with the rancher making cowpens on Friday. Two weeks of hard, solid work, two weeks of hard, solid pay. I saw the Fears, Andrew and Mary, at church two Sundays ago; which was very nice. Then worked the next week. And now I'm home. I left the Reckners on Saturday morning and returned to Georgia. Grandma is here. She'd been here for a week; I'm catching her on the second half of her visit. It was good to be at my home church again, even though the music is going in a direction that has me upset. Many old friends came and talked to me. I bought a Swiss WWII trench coat on Monday, something I've wanted to do for 4 years. It's gray (or grey; your preference on spelling). I got it dry cleaned, it deserved it after 60 years. That makes it \$18 for the coat, \$12 for the cleaning. I was kind of amazed at the prices in relation to each other. My sister Lydia's birthday is tomorrow, she'll be 8. I got her (horse) riding gloves (we have 4 horses). I got my teeth cleaned today. Why can't I make the dentist happy? I guess I should floss and brush better, that'd probably do it. I guess I should start flossing, never have done it before, it's too awkward. I wonder if Adam and Eve had dental problems. What about Moses, living on the backside of the desert? It's just a thought. So here we are, within shooting distance of Christmas. 10 days. I guess that makes it "three French hens", or do those days come after the 25th? And now that I have given you a speckled synopsis of my last few days, I will go to bed.
