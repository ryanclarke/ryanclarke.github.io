In honor of being on xanga for 668 days today, I have decided to surround Monday with three days of silence. Also, I've had no time to post.
Saturday - Drove to Phoenix with Faas and had a blast with Jen and family.
Sunday - Continued having a blast with Jen and also this guy named Peter. Got home to Payson at midnight.
Monday - I went into work at 5:20am and worked until just after noon when Faas relieved me. I spent the afternoon scrambling around madly, and then took the 10:50 flight out of Phoenix to Atlanta, and ultimately Jamestown, Rhode Island, where I arrived at noon on Tuesday. I'm currently sitting in the island library.
You see, my Grandpa Clarke died on Saturday morning at about 1:00am. He was failing with cancer these last many months. Aunt Lori called Mom on Friday and said it looked bad, and he died before morning.
Seeing how I saw him quite infrequently, the news didn't really sink in over the busy weekend or the neck-cramp-filled plane rides. Now that I'm here on the island, it's starting to hit more. The visiting hours are tonight and the funeral is tomorrow. I really don't know what is all going on, I'm just trying to keep Andrew from being totally bored.
My emotional state is basically a growing gratefulness for Grandpa Clarke's public confession of belief in Christ back in June. What a comfort and joy that is.
God is good.
Ryan
