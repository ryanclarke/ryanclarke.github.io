Living on the moist side of damp.
Today was cleaning day! I washed every inch of everything with soap and water. I even climbed inside the baghouse to wash it. I'm officially not claustrophobic. It was like a wet, bubbly torture chamber. But all that is done now and I've re-emerged from my shiny, stainless steel world. It all has to be sterile because we're drying a secret nano-material from Nevada on Monday.
By the way, yesterday was paper waste - NOT sewage. Just making that clear. Lest you wonder.
It's about time for my weekly bath! (just kidding) I have to shower the dust off every night, even though tonight I dread the though of more water.
Yours in the dry heat evaporatingly,
Ryan
