What is it with the electric-wheel-chair-ed folks in this town?
When: Saturday night
Where: Wal\*Mart
Who: old woman in an electric whell chair with an air tank in her basket and the air hose in her nose
What: shopping for metal detectors
Why: (?!?!?!?)
Then today we saw a lady driving her wheel chair down the sidewalk along the main drag away from Wal\*Mart trailering a red Radio Flyer wagon loaded with everyday low price items. Nice rig there ma'am.
I'm reminded of the time two months ago when I saw about 3 teenage boys driving through town on a wheel chair. Buckle up, it's the law.
On a personal note, I scored a goal in soccer today with the Mexicans. Makes me happy. It wasn't a pretty goal, but it still counts for one.
