Teresa was very good at her recital tonight. The music was pretty adn I appreciated the personalized insights into the works being performed. Poetic artistry. Thank you for the effort you put into preparing that recital Teresa
 The kind folks at Cornerstone Baptist Church made a meal after the service just for the Verity students. It was really good. They are so nice.
 As we draw close to that time when we graduate and leave this place, our thoughts turn to some of the more important issues of life. Um, yeah. Like, "How many couples do you think with come out of the '05 class?" Um, yeah. At least it's a good conversational stimulant. So I guess that could be construed into a plus. Um, yeah.
