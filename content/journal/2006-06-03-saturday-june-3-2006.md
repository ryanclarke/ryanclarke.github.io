God blessed me this year at the Nashville Training Conference. Sometimes there are deep things on my heart, things I cannot share. Sometimes I put them there, and sometimes it's God who places those intense inner issues. Sometimes I say nothing because I feel I shouldn't, but often it is because I have no way to possibly express that internal life. And with all that I will say that the Lord blessed me this week, at my core. I look forward to what He might do with me, for me, in me, and through me. I love a God of mercy and power.
My time as a child in my parent's house is nearly over. The Lord has been teaching me patience recently, but looking back, all this waiting I do doesn't turn out to be so long after all. My kidhood is gone. Next week, I move to Arizona. The story is awesome, and continuing, God is looking out for me in all the particulars. I feel Him there.
