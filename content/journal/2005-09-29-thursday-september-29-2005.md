So I am writing sarabandes and gavottes in class. I never did like those from the suites, but here I am, writing Baroque dance forms. And I've manages to work a few complicated chords into my 'pieces'.
 Tonight we're making dinner. Jrod is hand-making salsa. Go figure. I bought stuff to make sandwiches, Jrod bought stuff to make sause by hand. It should taste good though. And we're having some sort of Mexican food for dinner, Jrod-made. Breaking news: Jrod just said that he doesn't have a girlfriend, and he he isn't going to marry her either. I think I just took that out of context. Anyway, Boulden and Beeman are coming over to partake in the culinary masterpiece. I should probably go help.
 Oh, and the cold snap that started yesterday afternoon is over, mostly. It was cold for awhile.
 I miss everyone (I think that should cover all of that).
 Ryan
