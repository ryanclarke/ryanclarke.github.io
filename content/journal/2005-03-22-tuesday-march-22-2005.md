Yesterday nothing happened. Except that we analyzed just about all of Mozart's 40th Symphony. And started on Brahms' 1st Symphony.
 Today class was off. No class. So we all packed up and went to the zoo. What a nice little place. We tried to get into the dolphin show, but it was \$2.50, so we went down to the free part and watched the bottom side of the show. That was very interesting. The dolphin is one creature with some good hydrodynamics. They can cruise. So after seeing all sorts of wildlife we headed for the HQ. Now I have a headache. But I need to get some Brahms analyzed.
 Let me just dedicate this week to music theory geeks everywhere.
