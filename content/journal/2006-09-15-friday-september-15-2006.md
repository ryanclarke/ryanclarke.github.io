I got to talk to a man about his soul today. He didn't get saved, but the Lord was really working in his heart. He was definitely perturbed in spirit. I think it was some good ol' Holy Spirit action.
He was originally from Romania, ethnically Jewish (he could read Hebrew), some sort of Orthodox Christian in early life and current on Catholic news, well read on Islam (though he hated Muslims), and basically a cosmic humanist with some secular humanist ideas. He sincerely espoused moral relativism. I wish he could have heard how foolish it sounded. Actually I think he started to realize how senseless he appeared, to be buying all that idiocy. I must have reminded him 8 times that truth is always true no matter what.
So we were talking along about politics and religion and science and history and being all nice and tolerant about each others and everyone else's beliefs. But the discussion became more and more serious until I finally quit the wimpy, political correctness and put it all plain. "If I believe one thing and you believe totally another thing, then at least one of has to be wrong. There can only be one truth." He started to complain that I had no right to say such things. But we talked along for the longest while. I explained that I wasn't going to heaven because I was a good person, but because I was a freely admitted bad person whom God had forgiven through the payment of His Son Jesus Christ on the Jerusalem cross 200 years ago. As soon as I admitted to being a sinner he admitted to being one also, which seemed to make him quite uncomfortable. He said that we going to have to pay for his own sins with his own death and that after death he believes he will cease to exist. I told him I believe hell was waiting, which he didn't like, but he frankly admitted that he was scared of death. He said that I believed in heaven, which is why I was happy, but his life was sad and scared. After that point he started throwing up these wild smokescreens, so I just ended the conversation figuring that he had already heard enough truth for God to use. He was definitely feeling some sort of spiritual discomfort because he was agitated, although still affable, and was pacing. He seemed like he was desperately trying to cling to his crumbling worldview.
I pray that God does a work in his heart. He thanked me for talking as we parted, and I told him I would pray for him. May God touch him with living power. Pray for George.
