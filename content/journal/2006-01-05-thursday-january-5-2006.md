The promised pictures, finally!
 I want to the 2nd waterfall today. It wasn't quite as impressive as the 3rd or 4th, but still worth the hike. Samaha, Sarah, and I trekked out there and got several nice pictures of that wonder of God in nature. Then Boulden, Samaha, and I walked out to the front entrance and took several Verity 'promo pics'. Examples of each are below.

 And the whole thing finished tonight. It was a great conference. I think I want to come back here next year.
