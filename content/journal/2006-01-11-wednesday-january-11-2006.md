For those of you who were confused, The Exciting News that I was talking about in my first post yesterday, was revealed in my first-ever second-post-of-the-day. Yes, the Symphony concert is pretty big news.
 And now for today's big news: I submitted my first ever assignment for a portfolio. Yeehaw! I'm a real college student now! We'll see how this goes.
