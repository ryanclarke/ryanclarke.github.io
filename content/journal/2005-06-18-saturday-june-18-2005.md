I'm home, finally. I made it back on Thursday. So here I am at home. I'm loving being with my family. Unfortunately, work follows me. Actually, it's music work, so that's not bad at all. I'm working on editing my second symphony for the concert on July 21st by the Lapeer Civic Orchestra. I get to go to my church tomorrow. So I'm going to bed now.
 I'm sure you all were just dying to here all of that.
 Ryan
