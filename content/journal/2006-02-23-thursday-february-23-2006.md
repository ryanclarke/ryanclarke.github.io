Today was one of those good days of class. We had fun, and we learned.
An interesting this has happened: we started the week with 9 students, we ended class today with 4. A combination of "going home for the weekend" and "prior commitments on Thursday afternoon" have created than sharp dwindling.
Visitation Weekend starts today; translation: dessert at 8:15pm in the Upper Dining Room! I think. Either way, I'll be there just to check it out.
