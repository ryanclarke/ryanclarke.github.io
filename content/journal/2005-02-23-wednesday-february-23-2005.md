So I'm registrar for a day. I sit here in the office and tie my tongue into bizarre knots on the phone.
 --- actual conversation, 2nd of the day ---
 "Ryan, this is Verity Education." (Oops, backwards)
 "Oh, I know you."
 "How are you Pastor Shoemaker?" (Probably shouldn't have said "Education" after "Verity.")
 "Sure, I'll transfer them to your phone at their office please." (What a fat tongue! What was that supposed to mean?)
 "God bless you welcome... I mean, thank you... whatever." (fat tognue again...)
 I'm doing a smashing job. "Smashing" is the key word. People call up,
 "Verity, this is Ryan."
 "Hi, my name is [kid's name]. Is Kendra there?"
 "No, I'm dreadfully sorry. She is out."
 "Do you know where she is?"
 "Yes, she's hitting the slopes at Caberfae."
 "A what?"
 "Yeah, a whole posse of girls went up for the day."
 "Oh. Well I just wanted to ask some questions about Verity."
 "Great! I can transfer you to the right Sandy to ask about questions to." (Oops, fat tongue)
 "OK."
 "Call back if she's not there and I'll see what I can do."
 \<transfer and hang up: beep\>
 "Oh no, wrong extention."
 \<Micah's phone starts ringing\>
 \<Mad dash across the hall\>
 \<Micah's phone stops ringing\>
 \<I tackle Micah's phone\>
 \<Arlan looks up calmly\>
 \<I am tackled on Micah's phone\>
 "Hi?"
 \<Arlan calmly resumes reading his book\>
 \<I am thinking if I am OK\>
 \<Registrar's phone starts ringing!\>
 \<Mad dash across hall\>
 \<I pick up phone\>
 "Verity, this is Ryan."
 \<Phone rings again\>
 "What?!"
 \<Phone rings again\>
 \<I realize that the other phone is ringing, there are two in the registrar's office\>
 "Verity, this is Ryan."
 "Hey, it's [that kid again]. The extension didn't work."
 \<I think, "Yes, it did."\>
 "She wasn't there."
 \<"No, it was Micah's phone"\>
 "Let me run over to her office and check."
 "OK."
 \<"And don't do anything stupid while I'm gone."\>
 \<Mad dash across hall\>
 \<Sandy isn't in\>
 \<Mad dash across hall\>
 "No [I can't remember your name so I won't say it], her office is away." (fat tongue)
 "That's OK, it wasn't really important anyway."
 \<Phone rings\>
 \<I panic\>
 Phone 1: "I'll call back later."
 P2: "Verity, this is Ryan"
 P2: "Hi."
 P1: "OK, that will be fine."
 P2: "Is Kendra there?"
 P1: "Will an hour be OK?"
 P2: "No, I'm sorry she's out. [forget the bit about her skiing... there's no time!]"
 P2: "OK, then, I'll call back later."
 P1: "Yes. [hang up!]."
 P2: "When will she be back?"
 P1: "OK."
 P1: \<hangs up, I rejoice\>
 P2: "She'll be back tomorrow."
 "OK, I'll call then. Thank you."
 "Shi shi." (what? Chinese?)
 \<I breath deep breaths and try to put both brains back together\>
 So, Kendra has a really exciting job. And who says you don't get a workout holding down an office job? You probably don't believe this, but everything in the 'second' conversation happened. Just it was from three different conversations. Basic break-up: 1. Caberfae, 2. mistransfer, 3. double barreled. So, it's all real folks! Wow Kendra, what a job...
