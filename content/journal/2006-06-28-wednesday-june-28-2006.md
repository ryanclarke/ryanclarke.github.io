Just call me Streak.
I went over 45 mph for the first time since I've bought my car- I went 75 mph down a mountain.
So I returned Faas to the airport today. I tell you, Payson is way nicer weather-wise than The Valley (Phoenix) where the heat kills. So we had a nice ride in, and I had a long ride back by myself. It was a good (and long) prayer time though. It wasn't all boring - one stretch of road is dedicated to Valhalla. Go figure. It was great to have Faas in for a few days, and I look forward to seeing him again.
So I returned to the 30 mph roads of Payson. The coworkers were drying some sort of latex stuff that is a pain to clean (which I'm currently taking a short breather from). The Big Boss left for home (CA). And tonight I have an empty cabin again. I can't wait to move into The Vicarage!
And so, life wafts madly along. God is good.
Back to the crazy water park!
Ryan
edit-
I'm finished. I'm soaked. I'm tired. I'm going home.
