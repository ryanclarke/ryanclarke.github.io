I haven't found a church to join today. I did make a good contact. A woman with a doctorate in music who has a finger on the pulse of Payson's musical life. I'm excited about that. Once I get settled in, I'll have to start working myself into the music scene around here. If I could have a part in founding a local symphony, I would have a group that I could write music for. That would be neat. Working with a Verity Chamber Orchestra helped me out so much I would like to have more opportunities like it. I might be making dust for a living, but I haven't abandoned my music!
Another week starts tomorrow.
