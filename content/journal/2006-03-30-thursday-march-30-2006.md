Today was the last day of teaching class. It was fun teaching this class. I praise the Lord and I thank the Verity leadership for this opportunity to strengthen my understanding of the material while sharing my love for it. It was a dream come true. Next up: the final test on Saturday.
Today we had Park Night! It was great to be out on the old soccer field again. Beautiful weather.
