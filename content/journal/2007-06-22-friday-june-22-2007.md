I went for a walk today through the neighborhood here. They have little walkways among the houses and and ravines in the area. So I took pictures. Here's a nifty tree house that I found.

 Tonight was 10-year-old girls softball night. I saw 5 different games (10 teams) at two different schools in 1 hour. It was the handy paths that allowed me to cover ground and see so much. And they even have bridges over the ravines to make the walk more fun (ie. easy).

Then I finished the walk with a stop into the Wired Monk coffee bistro for a little drink. Pleasant little neighborhood. Except that no one responds to my cheery "hi!" or "good evening!" as I pass them on the trail.
