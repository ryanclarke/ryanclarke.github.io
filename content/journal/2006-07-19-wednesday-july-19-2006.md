Our bosses paid for dinner tonight. And it was a tasty dinner. For the appetizer we had calamari, which is squid. Last time I had squid was in Pinghu, China at Ming Tien Coffee Language: it was dry and crispy and had a 10 hour aftertaste. This stuff was fried and tasty. All though I didn't eat the whole baby squid they served me, just the pieces of more mature squid. Faas ate the baby for me. Yummy little fried sea monsters.
Tomorrow we're drying some ceramic stuff while the customer watches. I hope it goes smooth.
