We had a really good time of prayer and praise tonight geared towards the Verity Romanian trip. About 50 of us gathered together in the Lord to consecrate this adventure to Him. I am excited about the great things God is going to do with my Verity friends as they are over in Romania these next few weeks. The Lord be with them!
