I went to the Carrollton library today. I haven't been there in years. Why is it that I get such excitement from being near so many books that I can't hope to read? Maybe it's from the proximity to few books I will get to read. Those few make it work it. I enjoy walking down the aisles reading the titles of books that contain such wonders: The Geography of the Ancients, The 100 Greatest Movies of the Past 50 Years, Shakespeare Critiqued, About Bermuda, A Legend in His Time. Okay, the last title I did not see, but I would have looked at it if I had seen it! I ended up getting some fairly dry books on careers. Future necessities beckon.
