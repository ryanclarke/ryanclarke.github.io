The extended family continued to flow in, until there was no more to flow in. So we have all 4 of them here. 2 are here, and 2 are at Aunt Lori's and Uncle Dale's. Some super-extended family dropped through for today. As in, Dad's extended family. But both of them will be leaving soon.
 So Christmas has started. Although I got a jump start on it and started drinking the eggnog back in November. Did you know that Kroger has the half gallons for only \$1.50? Good stuff. I usually drink two half glasses back to back.
 As Santa says, "Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum." Wait, I'm getting two things mixed up.
