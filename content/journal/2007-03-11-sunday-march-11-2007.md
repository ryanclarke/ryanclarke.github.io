Tonight our youth group went over to these people's house and watched Facing the Giants. It was an incredible movie. Well done and with a powerful Christian message about our need to glorify God in everything and God's power and goodness that He shows in our life. And it was sooooo Georgian: it made me homesick.
Then a few of use went bowling. On guy's dad owned a bowling alley and movie theater for many years, so he was really good. He gave me a few pointers that helped me go from seven straight gutterballs to three straight strikes in the first game. Then my wrist and fingers started tiring from not having played in ages, so my score went back down again. It was fun.
So I guess you all will be changing your clocks at 2:00am up to 3:00am. Not so here: Arizona stays the same. I like it staying still since I can get up when it's dark and still have some daylight to play tennis after work. Although it really interferes with phone calls to Eastern Daylight Time since now we'll be 3 hours different.
