I must have got some food poisoning at Chile's yesterday at lunch. I was up part of the night vomiting. I made it to work an hour late, and my boss let me go home about 3:50pm. He's a great guy. I wasn't ill enough to call in sick, but not well enough to do much work. It was one of those days where you learn endurance. I finally was able to get (and keep) some food in my system this evening, so I'm feeling better. I want to be well tomorrow: "Mr. Blueman" arrived tonight so we 'get' to see him tomorrow. Life sure keep you on your toes (or knees)!
On a personal note, I walked under a semi's trailer for the first time in my life today. I must be growing up.
