Andrew and I went to the dump to dispose of our trash. This is what he said on our road home.

Andrew: Deers are used to the sound of cars but they don't like cars. Isn't that funny? Did you know that if you're covered in spices you won't rot? I was just thinking about that because we drove past the cemetery back there: the one with the dead people. In the old days - I don't think they do it anymore - in the old days they used to bury people in the Pharaoh places. You know, those things. They had hallways and were big. And I was thinking: wouldn't it be funny today if they buried people in one?

Ryan: I think it would be expensive.

Andrew: I guess so.
