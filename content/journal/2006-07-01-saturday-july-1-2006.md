My new home.
The Vicarage \*
![The Vicarage](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v300/classicalRyan/TheVicarage.jpg)
\* 2 bedrooms each with two walk-in closets, 2 full baths, large living room with commanding stone fireplace, dining room, U-shaped kitchen, laundry facilities, wrap-around front porch, patio, shed, all appliances included, U-shaped driveway. (note the lace curtains in the Guardhouse overlooking the Vehicle Bay)
I moved in today. Better put: I dumped all my stuff on the floor today. I'm be actually moving in over the next few days. I'll also be buying those essential household items which we don't always realize are so essential until we don't have them.
You know, moving from the cabin to The Vicarage looks so easy in writing.
Ryan
