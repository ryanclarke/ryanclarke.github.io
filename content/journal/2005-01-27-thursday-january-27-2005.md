My classes are going very well. I love my kids, for the most part, and my teaching assistant/translator is really great. His English name is Steven. My morning class is under control now. I've have very few real problems with Tom, and the afternoons are pure joy. All the kids love me, which is pretty amazing. I feel sort of popular. Most of the time they are glued to every word I say, even though they might not understand quite a few of them. I'm liking this teaching, even though it gets tiring. I do wish I had more time to shop and sightsee. This morning we had off form class so I went shopping. There are lots of little places to hop into here in Pinghu. I'm enjoy life. Everything is going great. The computer situation is changed here, so the only times the computers are available are while we are teaching, so it really limits the chance to write. I've got to go to a meeting now.

Well, I'm back. I found out at the meeting that they are going to keep the computer lab open until 7:30pm. Very nice. That will give me about an hour every night. So I'm editing this post.

I went shopping today. I went to this tailor and clothes market and I'm getting a traditional Chinese silk coat made. Tailor-made. It was ¥150 (\$18.26). What a deal. I'm going to do more shopping tomorrow probably. I hate spending money, but the jian (yen) over here look so fake it's like playing Monoply, and about a cheap also.

By the way. I got my hair done twice. About two blocks down from the school is a little salon. You go upstairs to get the hairwash and massage. I got Zhon Li both times. She does a really great job. She also speaks some English, so it's a great way to practice Chinese and learn some new words. The massage is only arms and neck. I don't think I could stand a full body one! Actually, it feels really good. After the wash and massage, you go downstairs to get you hair blowdried and combed. The first time I went with my normal comb-over, but the second time I went with more of a spiked look. It actually was close to a finger-in-the-light-socket look. I liked it, I guess. That was Saturday night, so I didn't wash my hair in the morning and went to church like that. I figured my hair was cleaner than it had ever been in my whole life after a one hour wash. It was ¥15 (\$1.82) for the whole hour.

Life is grand. I'm living like a millionaire in a resort... Hope you scraping by alright.
