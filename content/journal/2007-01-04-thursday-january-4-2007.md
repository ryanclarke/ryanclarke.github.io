Two days short of seven months ago (ei. June 6th) I bought my '98 Buick Century. It came with one ignition key, one electronic beeper fob and no door key. The salesman was regretful, but it's a used car so there's not much he could do about the missing door key. Door keys can be very expensive to make, especially when they have that little computer chip in them like mine does. So for Christmas my parents decided to pay for me to get a door key made. I called this really friendly local locksmith yesterday and explained my problem, he said he could help. I called him again this evening just as I was about to head over to his shop. He said, "Wait a minute, it's '98 Century? The door key and the ignition key should be the same!" I went out and tried the ignition key in the door for the first time in nearly seven months - and it worked. Viola. They say you learn something new everyday...
So that was my Christmas gift.

PS. The other part of the gift was money to get a duplicate made, which will still be very nice.
