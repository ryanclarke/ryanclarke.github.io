I'm back from the crazy adventuring at Lake Powell.
We were out in the Great Western Desert Wilderness And Sprawling Man-Made Lakes section of our country where there are hardly any modern conveniences like cellphone reception or warm showers. After hours of drive, hours of swimming, hours of sleeping on the ground, and hours of hanging out and chaperoning kids with an often low maturity to energy ratio, I'm fairly tired. I'll post the few pictures I have later. I didn't take many because of all the water, both lake and rain. But for now, since I've had my shower: sleep (the in-a-bed kind!). Actually, for all the hardships and complaining that camping often spawns, it's still a lot of fun.
