Happy New Year, 2006!
 This is the year when Christ will become the most important in my life.
 And to start it all off, I'm going to go into the depths of a place with no internet. I'm going to The Wilds music conference. I'll be back on Friday. Don't expect to hear anything from me until then. I'm pretty excited about this conference. And I get to see many Verity and former Verity students, including David Prentice and Sarah Ness!
