I went to one of the best concerts I have ever attended last night. JRod and Cameron sang in the chorus of Mahler's 2nd Symphony. The orchestra was massive. They had 11 horns! Hooray! The off-stage brass effects were really neat. It was a grand night. The music was awesome and the donuts afterwards with good friends was memorable.
 I relaxed today. After two weeks of concentrated music theory followed by two weeks of concentrated biology, I needed a rest. And now, I finally feel relaxed enough to really relax. I fell asleep briefly out on the grass with the light breeze blowing and the sun shining not to hot. It was great. Life is pretty hard, but it's a heap of fun if you have the right attitude.
 This morning in church the pastor said something that really solidified a thought I had floating around in the back of my head. Here is my concentrated statement, you may quote me.
 "Humanism has not only deified man, but in the very process of making man supremely significant it has made human life worthless. By denying a creator, humanism has made abortion and euthanasia culturally possible. Thus we have a paradox: life is so important that life is valueless."
