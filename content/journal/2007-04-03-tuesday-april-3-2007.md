If it smells like urine, feels like urine, and looks like urine, what is it? Some nutraceutical product that we get to dry tomorrow. Actually, it's not quite that bad, but I'm still wondering who's willing to pay all that money to EAT IT?
I'm hungry. But that's totally unrelated ... um ... believe me.
Today I received a few sanctification pointers that I need to work on to become a better man. Being optimistic, I usually see the good points in life, including myself. It's easy to forget about the endless rough edges I have and how rough some of them are. God must love me, because He won't stop pruning till I'm an awesome guy. I wonder how long that will take (answer: my whole life).
On a personal note, I'm throwing a SURPRISE PARTY on Saturday night for the sole purpose of seeing who will come. To make it more surprising, I'm not telling anyone about it. By the way, I'm making an exception to the silent rule: you're invited too. But in keeping with the secrecy of the event, you may not tell me you're coming.
