Chim chiminey, chim chiminey, chim chim cher-ee!
Dried some Lithium Manganese Oxide (LiMn2O4) today. Used it batteries, this special solution is going to be used in high-end electric cars. It's a very fine powder that likes to float in the air like dust. And it's black. This is what a representative portion of me looked like by the end of the day.

 I wonder what the people in Wal\*Mart thought.
"Well ma'am, I'm a chimney sweep. Don't you know I'm on the endangered species list for Arizona. Just kidding. I'm a beta tester for a tissue company. We're coming out with new chocolate scented tissues. I'm sorry, it's just a sunburn, that's all."
I am as lucky as lucky can be! (blessed by God)
