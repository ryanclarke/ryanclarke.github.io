The Dow Gardens were amazing. So lovely. I'm not really a flowers person because I'm pretty color-impaired and have allergies. But here in Michigan I have had no nose problems. And the flowers were so bright and fresh. I could not help enjoying myself. The design was really good to: well laid out.I liked how the trees block the line of sight creating the illusion of endless little areas. It was perfect, almost like a dream backyard. And the weather was wonderful. A great day.
