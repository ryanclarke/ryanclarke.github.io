Clarification on the clasification system for specialists.
 Levels of Experts:
 [Dweeb](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=dweeb)\*
     One who is interested in a particulary area and has done some study on it, but has yet to gain any real understanding of ability in that area.
[Nerd](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=nerd)
     One who has aquired a considerable amount of knowledge on a subject. Can manage to make himself completely misunderstood by the rest of the world through his use of jargon.
[Geek](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=geek)
     One who has amassed amazing quanities of knowledge and experience and is very capable in minute fields of study, usually at the expence of much time, tuition money, and brain power. Can intellegently converse with other experts in the appropriate jargon. Can fry a nerd's brain.
[Guru](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=guru)
     One of the top few experts in the world. Usually knows more about some particular thing than anyone else, making him highly respected and idolized by all nerds and geeks.
 I hope this helps anyone who was confused by the last blog and it's subseqent comments. I am hoping to graduate from music theory nerd to music theory geek before I leave Verity. And I'm only a computer dweeb, probably never will make it to nerd.
