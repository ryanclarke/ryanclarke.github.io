On Mozart's 250th!
 I made it back to Flint. I'm packed and moved and traveled and haircutted. I'm ready.
 Tonight is the (first) big night! The world premiere of my completed Symphony No. 2 in F Major! For some reason I'm not terribly excited right now, sort of. I guess that now that it's almost here, it's hard to believe it's true. Like a dream. Well, it will be wonderfully real in just two hours!
 And on Mozart's 250th as a bonus! Though others have come and gone, Mozart has remained one of my top-favorite composers for about a decade. His second symphony was written at 9: more than half as young as me. Oh well, he died at 35, and I hope to live more than twice that, so it evens out.
 And here we go!
 Ryan
