I'm enjoying the home life.
Today we went to a wedding of some old friends from church. Quite a nice time. I was able to catch up with quite a bevy of folks I hadn't had any contact with since contact with them ceased when I moved to Arizona.
Today Lydia turned 10 years old. Not everyday do you get to add a digit to your age. She's growing into quite the young lady.
I love my family.
Ryan
