I'm home!
 Bryce and I just got back to my place after a 10+ hour drive. It was pretty uneventful. Except for the trucker who waved at us to pull over and then tried to buy a horse from us on the side of the interstate.
 An interesting character. Seemed like a nice guy and used colorful words. Born in KY, he went to Vietnam and then got a Associates in Criminal Science from FSU. After an unenjoyable stint at a youth 'boot camp' for delinquents, he left because he couldn't beat up the kids who attacked him. He then became a trucker and he makes \$65,000 a year. Now 53 with an uncanny resemblance to Gen. Custer (or Last Stand fame), he has an 8 year old daughter. His hobby is horses and he has 2 paints. He's in the market for a black and white one. Recently he won a 100 mile endurance race winning a free saddle and belt buckle. He gave us his brand new cell phone number in case we change our minds and decide to sell the Reckner's black and white yearling, Endurance. And so we bid Custer goodbye, and pulled back onto the interstate.
 And so, I'm back home.
