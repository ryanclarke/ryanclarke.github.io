David Prentice came over on Saturday. He was in Georgia and stayed here. He left yesterday for his next leg of the trip to the Wilds music confrence. So he spent an overnighter with me and my family. It was great to see him again. We had so much fun. Today I'm going to be doing a lot of layout editing on a organ book for Word Music. That should keep me busy. And tomorrow I leave for Flint.
