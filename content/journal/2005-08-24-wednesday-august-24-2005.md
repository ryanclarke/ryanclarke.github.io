*“And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.”* Matthew 11:12

What does this verse mean? Why does this violence occur right in the middle of Jesus’ praise for John the Baptist? Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

*“The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence.”* The term “suffer violence” is easily misunderstood. My first thought was that it meant persecution, but that is only partially true. It is far more active than just sitting there and being beat up on. There is this connotation of eagerness and zeal, as of an unstoppable army that moves forward despite any contrary force. The kingdom of heaven is eternal and contrary to the world, therefore, it suffers violence and deals out violence.

*“And the violent take it by force.”* This phrase makes me picture a besieged castle, but this image is totally wrong. The word “take” literally means something more similar to “catch.” The word “force” refers to a fervent resolve. So rather than describing armed robbery, this phrase talks of accepting and clinging to Christ against persecution.

In light of these definitions, this verse could be rendered, “And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been advancing steadily against the forces of evil in this world, and passionate people accept and cling to Christ through intense persecution and peril.”

One thing that I find interesting about this, is that this verse is proceeded at the end of chapter 10 in verse 34 by Jesus’ statement, *“Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.”* He then just days later says this about violence. However this time He ends His dialogue, which includes curses on Capurnaum, with the startling statement, *“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”* (11:28-30)

Somehow we are to forcefully advance in peace. The violent men in this passage are forcefully taking *“the peace of God, which passeth all understanding.”* (Phil. 4:7) It is an interesting irony.

May I be a spiritually violent man: one eager and zealous for God against all odds.
