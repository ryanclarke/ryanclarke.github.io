I live a great life. I have so much fun and enjoy myself a lot. But even with all of this, I'm surprised that I can have a bad attitude. How is it possible to be so down when everything is so up? So, I have thought through both times I've been mad these last weeks, and they are both in relation to music. And they've both been aimed at JRod. It is not right to have anger. Proverbs 22:24 reads, "Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go." So, anyone who saw me mad at JRod, I want you to know that it was my wrong for being mad. No one can force another to sin, the sin is they're own fault. I want everyone to know, I really like JRod and I highly respect him as a musician.
