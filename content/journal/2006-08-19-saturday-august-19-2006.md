I have three different orders in the mail coming to me. All exciting stuff!
There's something about separating with such large quantities of cash all at once. I don't really like it. It's the 'saver' in me.
By the way, I finally tricked Amazon into giving me a working account and then ordering my stuff. So now I just have to wait the standard 2 to 3 weeks of processing and they will ship my stuff. How fast! I really don't know why people do business with them. I don't know why I do. Just begging for the privilege to be annoyed.
