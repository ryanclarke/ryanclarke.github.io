Well, it's nearly midnight because I'm on CST.
 I finished the first semester of Composition 1 today. Here are two of the better pieces I wrote today in MIDI format (you may skip the technical comments in the parenthesis if you wish):
 [Gavotte and Musette](http://www.ryanclarke.net/music/Gavotte-Musette.MID)
 (two pieces for piano - gavotte: large binary form, musette: small binary form)
 [Minuet with Trio](http://www.ryanclarke.net/music/Minuet-Trio.MID)
 (ternary proper form for string trio - minuet: large ternary form, trio: small binary form)
 I hope you enjoy them! I sure do. I enjoyed writing them.
 Ryan
