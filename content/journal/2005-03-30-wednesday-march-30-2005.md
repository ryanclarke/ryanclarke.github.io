I have a crazy life.
 So my computer has been broken for 5 days now. And I called Dell and they say it will be \$700 to fix, unless I buy the part and put it in myself for 'only' \$600. That is a lot of money, in case you didn't know. So I decided to have Arlan look at it. And he took it apart and fixed it! Don't ask me how, he is just amazing. So now I have a computer again. I love this thing. So, if you ask me about my day, you will get enthusiastic responses. I hearby confer upon Arlan 256,000 brownie points and a lifetime supply of free publicity.

 I drove Mr. Gothard's car. The big, blue '73 Olds that has "IBLP 2" for the plate. It was fun to drive. Arlan, JRod, Minna, and I drove it up from HQ here to the RCI. It broke down half way here. But again, Arlan is the man and fixed it, in 30 minutes, for \$20. He's the man. [Go here](../../home.aspx?user=secretparticleguy).
 Thank you Arlan.
 I am happy tonight.
