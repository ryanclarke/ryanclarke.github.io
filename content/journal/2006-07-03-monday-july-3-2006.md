Well, I'm taking a 4 day 'weekend.'
The PCS hierarchy decided to take the 3rd off in addition to the 4th. So I'm just catching up on sleep after running around like a maniac getting set up in the new house.
Although it's not set up as in "set up." I'm sleeping in on an air mattress in the living room because there are no lights in the bedroom. And that air mattress is the only piece of furniture. I got all disposable kitchenware, for now, except I forgot to buy silverware. So back to the store...
Tomorrow I'm going to a 4th of July picnic hosted by this church I've gone to twice now. I like the church. Should be fun. I met some great (old) people there.
