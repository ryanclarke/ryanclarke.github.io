Well, I promised more. Yesterday night I was very tired. I felt drained. For years my Mom would occasionally complain about continuously giving energy and never getting any back and how she was so exauhsted. I never really bought her story. Now I know what she meant: emotional energy. I'm not really an emotional person, but repeatedly giving hours of each day teach kids and counseling friends can get tiring. JRod really helps me recharge, and he's gone this week in Ningbo. I just got so tired I went to sleep really early. I went down at 8:00pm.
 This morning I woke up at 6 and walked around in the cold, I feel great. Taught this morning. It's great teaching, I kind of think it's fun, but it gets tiring for sure. Over the last three days I've taught 26 3rd graders the whole concept of plural. In Chinese there is no plural. It was tricky, but I won. The poor kids just about fried their brains. Now they can say "This is a ...", "That is a ...", "These are ...s.", and "Those are ...s." I'm kind of proud of myself. I didn't do anything yesterday other than go out for a nai cha (milk tea) at night. I just took it easy. I planning on going out tonight for dinner with some folks. So we'll see.
 Tomorrow is the last day of class. I'm on the home stretch. Then a few days of touring and we leave. I'll be sad to leave China, but it'll be nice to actually TALK to my family again and not just email.
