I'm back.
The sessions were amazing, insipring, convicting, funny, and practical.
The music was entirely unenjoyable, blaringly loud, but Christ-focused. I'm smart: I brought earplugs.
Our kids were awesome. We had a blast and learned a lot. They responded well to all the truths they received. That makes the weekend worth it.
