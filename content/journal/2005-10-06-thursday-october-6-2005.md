 I've been doing music theory for over a week: everything is really funny now.
 Dr. Kincaid: "Her elevator didn't go to the top floor."
 Emily (White): "It's really wierd to hear my thoughts coming out of your mouth."
 Ryan: "It's really wierd to have my words in your head."
 Dr. Kincaid: "What do you think this is, a summer home for hobos?"
 I'm writing a sonatina (for piano). The first movement is done. The last movement is well on it's way. The middle movement will be written sometime in the near future. As soon as the whole thing is done I'll post it.
 We had the Archbishop over all the Romanian Orthodox churches in America and Canada over for lunch today. We meaning IBLP. He had a beard, and a black robe, and a big, gold madalion thingy that hung on a massive chain around his neck. He spoke with a certain accent, and a heavy seasoning of "ums." \<new\> We invited him over so that he could check out the ministry and get a feel for the work we're planning on doing in Romania. We don't want the Romanian Orthodox church to feel like we're trying to steal their people or their position. 90% of Romanians belong to that church, so if they got that feeling, we'd have no success in helping Romania. Archbishop Nikolai was very impressed by the HQ and was almost in a daze when he left. It was funny, but I hope that he will rethink his theology, and if he doesn't know Jesus as his Savior, that God will draw Him. \</new\>
