Well, it's real late right now.
 I just got back from Mom's surprise birthday party. It was so fun to surprise her like that.
 Bryce Reckner arrived today. We are going to drive to Tampa, FL tomorrow. And then we drive back on Monday, or maybe Tuesday. It's going to be a great trip. I haven't spent time with him since last December. So we start our trek.
 Good night.
 Ryan
