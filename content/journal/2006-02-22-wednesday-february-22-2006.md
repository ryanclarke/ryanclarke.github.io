I made it through all of the many hours of today's class - again. For some reason I seemed to not be able to concentrate very well today. Oh well, I had to pull out the old forceful brain-focusing skills: not exactly a specialty of mine, being the King Of Rabbit Trails, Wild Goose Hunts, Bizarre Antics, Wacky Sayings And Other Such Amusing And Interesting Diversions. I thought being the teacher, I would be immune from the side-effect of highly-concentrated music theory. Well, at least it gives a uniform insanity to the entire group.
