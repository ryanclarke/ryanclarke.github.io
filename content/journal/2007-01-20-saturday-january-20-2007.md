God said "Good Morning, Ryan!" What a surprise.
 [![](http://x41.xanga.com/7a683b45552b8102308256/m72160157.jpg "Payson Snow")](http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/417a6102308256/photo.html)
In the words of the immortal song, "I'm dreaming of a white Muharram..." (today is the Islamic New Year 1428, NOT that I celebrate)
It's funny snow happened on the morning I had been planning for two weeks to get new tires put on my car. At least it underscores my reasons for desiring wheels with tread.
On a totally unrelated and seperate note (which has no bearing on the above remarks) and is also distinct in topic and lacking in logical progression from the original tone of this post, thus severing all ties, minus authorship, from the proceeding paragraphs, what would you think about writing a book?
