Good morning. I figured I'd do an AM post for once.
Last Saturday Faas and I helped chaperon our church youth group to the RAGE Music Festival (it was Christian music, oddly enough) at a theme park in Phoenix. Our bus broke down on the way there so we spent a hour on the side of a mountain and then where we got to The Valley (Phoenix) it was low 40's! Unheard of! I had a fun time, in the park only, since I totally don't like that type of music I didn't go to the concerts. I tell you, watching the other kids from the other church's, I wonder how long Western Civilization can last. Call me a stick in the mud, but at least I grew up with a sense of values and morals and ethics. I feel so sorry for those kids: looking desperately in all the wrong places. But I'm also a little scared for the future.
This week, same as last week, Faas and I are wiring large electrical control panels for two dryers our company sold to some folks in Nevada. It's pretty amazing, and I've learned how to 'read' these complex wiring diagrams. Long, tiring, tedious, but it's not a wet job (like cleaning the dryer) and it's quite interesting. I'm learning a new skill. I like it.
Also, I got my first Tax Form today. Yippee, I can't wait for the giant return that they overcharged me last year!
Now I'd better run off and get to work.
Ryan
