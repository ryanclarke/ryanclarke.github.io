"I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great congregation; Behold, I will not restrain my lips, O Lord, Thou knowest. I have not hidden Thy righteousness within my heart; I have spoken of Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation; I have not concealed Thy lovingkindness and Thy truth from the great congregation."
     \~ Psalm 40:9-10
Most scholars agree (okay, I only checked with Spurgeon's Treasury of Psalms) that this passage, and much of the entire Psalm, is written about Christ and His unwavering proclamation of the Kingdom of God's imminence during His years of ministry. When I read this passage this morning my first thought was on the evangelism training I'm going through with my church. When I insert my self in there, and switch all "the great congregations" out for the "the world" or "lost and helpless people."
May I be worthy of the task.
