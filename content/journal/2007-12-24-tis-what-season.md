By the way, what season is it anyway? I was at Best Buy last night and I walked over to the table where they were selling the holiday gift cards. I say "holiday" with purpose. I'm not using it as a contraction of holy and day used for Christian celebrations, I'm using it as an all-purpose, non-religious term for the 25th of December, or more, Thanksgiving through New Year's Day. (When was the last time you wished someone a happy holiday for July 4th? What about the Late Spring Holiday Season of Mother's Day, Memorial Day, Father's Day and Flag day?) So I'm standing at the gift card table and there are four different styles to suit everyone: Happy Kwanzaa, Happy Hanukkah, Love and Holiday (with a bride and a groom on it) and Giving Season with a gift. There wasn't a "Christmas", a manger, or a angel to be seen. Not even a serene looking female angel with long flaxen hair and a trumpet.

All I'm saying is that Christmas was a very big thing: God became man. It deserves a big celebration, and now it doesn't even get a mention from corporate people who 'know.' Sometimes it feels like they have taken the Christ out of Christmas and now they are destroying the last remnant of the X in Xmas. But I can still worship the newborn Christ, and that's what I plan to do, whether it's officially endorsed by Best Buy or not.
