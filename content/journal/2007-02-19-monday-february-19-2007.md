I don't normally do these things, but since it was my [sister](http://www.xanga.com/sarahdipityinlime) who tagged me, I'll acquiesce.
Six Weird Things About Me
    1- I am normal- like you've never seen normal before.
    2- I follow Jesus Christ and try to share Him with others.
    3- I believe that truth is absolute, and the Bible is God's Word.
    4- I love both of my parents (and they are not divorced).
    5- I love my 5 siblings.
    6- I'm happy.
I think that's the weirdest thing about me: I'm normal in a crazy, messed up, perverted world. And I am very grateful for my Christian upbringing.
You would not believe some of the incredible immorality I heard some of the youth kids discussing this last weekend while talking about the endless drama known as public school. And that was just the 14 year olds. Sick. I feel so sorry for the Christian kids in our church group who are surrounded by this mire daily and yet try to take a stand for Christ.
Be weird for Jesus. Don't hide your faith, your hope, or your Savior.
