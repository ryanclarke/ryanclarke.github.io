Everything that could go wrong at work went wrong. By about 4:00 it had all been tried, so things started going smooth again. And it happened on a day when I didn't want to work.
Why do the days I'm excited about work end up being slow and the ones where I just want to do my stuff and leave end up going crazy? I guess I need the motivation more when the work is harder to find. And on crazy days it doesn't matter how I feel: the job just has to get done. So while it seems backwards, I guess it's right after all. Huh.
Well, I learned something new today, so I guess I can go to sleep now.
