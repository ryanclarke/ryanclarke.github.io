Update: we're not leaving to go to New England for the family reunion until Friday morning. Departure has been pushed back one day.
 That was the most exciting thing I could think of.
 Oh, and I got the wheelbarrow's tire fixed (replaced), finally. Then Sarah, Lydia, Andrew and I went out and "mucked the barn" for an hour. Actually, that's a misnomer: it's really "*de*mucking the barn." The horses handle the be-mucking part, and quite voluminously I must say. Anyway, now the barn is less mucky. And when we go out there tomorrow it should get even less mucky.
