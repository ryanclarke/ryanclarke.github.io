OAK BROOK, IL--Â  Studies have proven that running backwards can be hazardous to your health. And well-being. And social palatability.
 Citing a recent test done on IBLP property, one of the subjects, Ryan, (who we will call Bobdorfenstienovesky to protect his identity) expounded on the risks: "Running backwards down a hill can easily cause you to summersault covering you with goose dung. Running backwards uphill causes the muscles on the front of your thighs to become fatigued. If you were thereafter in an emergency situation, such as jumping off a picnic table, you would not have the strength to catch your fall. You would then become covered in more goose dung. Either way you get covered in goose dung."
 Does this guy (what's his name?) have experience from which to speak? Judging from his clothes, yes. Our fear is that if he happened to be in an actual emergency situation, no one would want to help him. That would be tragic. To quote the study, "Goose dung is an inevitable consequence of running backwards: we have videos to prove it."
