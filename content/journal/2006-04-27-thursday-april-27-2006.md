JRod and IÂ  once again took the "Metrorrey" into the downtown of the city. This time we were shopping for souvenirs. I think I found some nice things for my family. I'm not really a junk guy, so sometimes it's hard for my to find trinkets to buy. So I found some non-trinkets. But, there were plenty of the other type.

Prepare for a good post tomorrow! Tonight we're going to a soccer game! Tigres versus Paraguay, so it's an international match. Believe me, I'm not going to make the probably fatal mistake of cheering for Paraguay. The Tigres are from Monterrey so I'll cheer for them just to be safe, and to ensure a repeat invite from the Rodriguezes.
