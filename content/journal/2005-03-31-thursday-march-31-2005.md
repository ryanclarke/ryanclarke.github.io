The biggest pieces of news in my life are:
 1. Arlan didn't fix anything for me today.
 2. Arlan is still the man.
 3. Biological evolution is interesting.
 4. Sandy spit water all over Callie and Jeanne at lunch, but it was all my fault and I apologized.
 5. I did dishpit for Minna, which is a wet job, but enjoyable one when spent in pleasant banter with someone like Allison, or maybe even Allison herself.
 6. Minna is very funny.
 7. Those little cellphones they are coming out with these days are pretty nifty.
