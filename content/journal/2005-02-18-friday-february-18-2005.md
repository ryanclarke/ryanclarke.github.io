Well, I am back with China pictures!
 The last 4 and a half days we toured around to several Chinese cities and saw the notable places there. So, the first thing each morning was a two hour bus ride to the city-of-the-day. And the last feature at night was the bus ride home. Fortunately, the buses were large and comfortable. Blake and I head off for adventure.

 Most of the notable places were rock gardens, beautiful rock gardens. On Monday we went to Suzhou and saw many beautiful sights, including a nice, covered bridge which Callie, Sarah, and I took a rest on.

 The most interesting thing in Suzhou was the old city wall and gate. I love strategic architecture, and this is one point in which Europe and Chinese paralleled each other: in their construction of gates and walls. Sarah, Callie, Sandy, and I ascend the inside access ramp to the old Suzhou city wall while a Chinese man descends.

 Actually, it was a double gate. There was a huge outer gate and a smaller inner gate. In between was courtyard where the enemy could be systematically slaughtered by archers from the surrounding wall. It was a very efficient system. The double gate in the canal worked the same way, except that it destroyed the navy instead of the army. Sarah, Sandy, Callie, and I arrayed accross the opening of the outer gate.

 Inside the courtyard were many ancient Chinese weapons with which we could reenact gruesome performances. The weapons themselves were pretty savage. Take a look at that pencil!

 Callie and I doing A Chinese Gothic. A foriegn take on an American masterpiece. We were still living and thinking like Americans, even in China.

 And a word of advice: don't get a pair of twins mad at you with that many weapons around. What a scary experience, I don't think Callie and Sandy realized it was only supposed to be a photo opportunity!

 Yes, Suzhou was fun city. I would go back there again without hesitation, assuming, of course, that I'm ever in the neighborhood again. I'll post pictures of Hangzhou later. Also, many of these picture were not taken by me, I am only using them because I'm in them. So, many thanks to Margie, Kendra, and Ben for taking some of these great shots.
