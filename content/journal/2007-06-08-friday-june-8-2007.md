I've decided to become a celebrity. Does anyone know some good paparazzi in the Greater Payson Metropolitan Area \*cough\*? Yes, I've always dreamed of being draped across the checkout aisle in Wal\*Mart beneath slanderous headlines.
I'm just not sure about the whole adopting native children thing: I'd rather have my own.
Now to figure out what to be a celebrity for. I can't be famous for being famous or rich, because I'm neither. Yet. That leave me with one alternative: 'lack of any distinguishable talent.' I'll join the hordes of people who's only claim to fame is being in every issue of The Irrational Admirer since distant memory. Or I could try being arrested and released and rejailed. But face it, a celebrity has to really want it in order to be actually locked up, most just settle for endless trips to rehab.
You may all take an unflattering picture now.
