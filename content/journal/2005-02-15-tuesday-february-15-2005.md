More pictures!
 I guess I'll start at the biginning with the long plane ride. It was still rather fun, and I managed to stay awake the whole trip.

 The first couple of days everything was very new. We were fairly lost most the time, but took lots of pictures of it.

 One thing they have lots of in China is rock gardens. Some were fairly ordinary heaps of stone, but others where whole caves with mazes of tunnels and staircases cut through them.

 I already miss the milk tea, or nai cha. I liked the xiang yu nai cha without pearls best. "Xiang yu" means it is Chinese sweet potato flavored.

 One of the highlights of the first week was going and touring the old Mo family residence from the Ming Dynasty where I somehow got in one of Margie's pictures. What can I say, I'm a musician.

 Here is a picture of me trying out a traditional Chinese instrument, the guzheng. It was really fun to play! I sort of like the old Chinese folk music. After four weeks it starts to grow on you.

 I hope you enjoyed these. There are more coming....
