The opera last night was incredible, and hilariously funny.
Today I finished up teaching Harmony 1 and the test is on Monday morning, so my job is done. I pray that my students do well.
Right now, I'm going to the Flint Generals hockey game. I've never see one before, so this should be fun.
I'll fill in all the details for this list-like post later.
Ryan
