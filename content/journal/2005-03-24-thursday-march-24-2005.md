Music theory takes intense brain power.
 Brahms was harmonically advanced. A lowered augmented tonic six of C minor becoming the lowered augmented submediant six of E flat major? Wow, that is pretty crazy right there. Check out measure 71, 4th 8th-note, of the first movement of his Symphony No.1 in C Minor.
 Friends with cellphones are nice: free calls home after 9 o'clock pm! So I got to talk to my family again, finally.
 Wow, so this is spring break. I love college.
