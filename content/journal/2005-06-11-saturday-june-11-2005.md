I went into Chicago city today. Arlan came up today, and we went into town with him. JRod, Minna, and I, that is. We went to Grant Park where the Buckingham Fountain is and we saw Millenium Garden. Then we went to eat at Sweet Basil Thai Restaurant. Very good food. I got fried noodles, of course. Then we hung out at the bookstore. Always a fun thing to do, and if we keep doing it I'll probably be able to finish 'reading' all the Far Side and Dilbert comics.
 Tomorrow we're going to church with Dr. Kincaid.
 After that, two more days of class, the day of the test, and then the day of departure. So that's the whole schedule.
