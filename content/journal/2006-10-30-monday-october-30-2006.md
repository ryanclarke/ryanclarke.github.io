Who knew they had ornery plywood in hell?
So I was innocently loitering in hell when I was suddenly assaulted by a a piece of scenery. From behind, it collapsed onto my head. I was surprised.
I went with the church youth down to this Judgment House in Mesa. It is a series of short skits which tell a story. Some of the characters die and go to heaven, and some go to hell. And they let you tag along. It was very well done with a salvation message and many of our kids talked to counselors afterwards. I think it had a powerful impact. Although maybe not as forceful as my blow in hell.
What a pain in the neck. Literally. The board must have pulled a muscle because I was unable to go to work today. I can hardly move my head. Hopefully I'll be better by morning.
Moral of the story: you don't want to go to hell, it's a pain in the neck.

PS. I'm making light of my injury, not capital 'H' Hell. Capital 'H' Hell is not funny: much worse than a stiff neck. Jesus died so you don't have to go there.
