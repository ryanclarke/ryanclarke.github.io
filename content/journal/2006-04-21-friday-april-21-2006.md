Today JRod and I got on the metro train system at the local stop and took it into the downtown area of Monterrey. We saw many things: statues, parks, fountains, an old cathedral, and the governor's palace. They were nice, old buildings. The cathedral was quite ornate on the outside.

Celebration inside!

The governor's palace had a nice pavement outside with statutes of famous Mexicans.

They seemed to have a lot out the outdoors indoor at the palace. I guess when you have this big of a house, you might want your own fresh air to breath early in the morning.

We spent quite a deal of time at this very nice museum. They had a really interesting history of Mexico going from the Mayans and Aztecs up to modern times. Very neat. All the signs were in Spanish, but fortunately most big Spanish words resemble English words, so I got along fine, with JRod helping out. Fortunately for him I couldn't read or we would have been there longer: I love to read all the signs, unless of course, I can't. The other exhibit was a temporary setup on the history of guns, particularly as relates to Mexico. So many historic guns, they even had an original Hotchkiss 8mm M1914 machine gun! From the picture below, you can see it was favored by the "Constitucionalistas" (who fought the Federales during a Mexican civil war). One wonders, are these friends of Blocki?

After the museum we went to a local restaurant for tortas de milanesa and we sat at talked for several hours. Then we went back and saw the owner's paintings. Right now a family with 4 kids is over for dinner. I've got to go!
Having fun!
