I was visiting some different 'big' websites out there to get ideas on a new design for our company's site. I happened across the [Boy Scouts](http://www.scouting.org/)' site. What a shock: the front picture was of a girl in a sailor uniform. Why in the world? So I had to go to the Girl Scouts site, and it was as girly as anything, complete with all sorts of girl links. Why do the Boy Scouts get stuck with a boring site and a sailor girl? Oh well, just another thing to add to the "Reasons the World is Bizarre" list. Not that I'm keeping one.
On a personal note, we're going to the first night in a 13-week Bible study. It's purported to be a rational look at truth and the Christian worldview. Good stuff.
