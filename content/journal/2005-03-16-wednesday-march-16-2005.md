Well, nothing is happening here at HQ. OK, I take that back. A lot is happening, but you won't care to know. We are analyzing music, which is very interesting to us, and very boring to most of you. So I will content myself with describing the fajitas that JRod made for dinner tonight instead of the Beethoven String Quartet Op.l8, No.1 that we surveyed. It was good. Well, they both were. There were about 8 of us partake of his dish. So that was a fun time. So fun, in fact, that we made it to class 10 minutes late. Oops.
