You know how fun it is to win, even in a win-win situation? Well, it's even more fun to win in a lose-lose situation. Then you really feel like you beat the system.
On a personal note, a guy at work bet me that the world will end in 2013. If he's wrong he'll give me a million dollars, if we all die that year I'll owe him. I took him up on it. Hey, I still enjoy a good win-win bargain. Unfortunately, after 5 seconds of thought, he took back his offer: there wasn't much in it for him.
