One week ago a posted here about following God’s will. One week has passed without an update, which is a record for me in recent months.

Last week I spent three days with Dad in Payson, AZ. Let’s just call it my new home. I accepted a job there on Thursday. God has amazingly brought me a good job with [Pulse Combustion Systems](http://www.pulsedry.com/): a Christian company that does industrial drying in a new and greatly superior way. I'll be starting the 3 month trial period in 3 weeks. I think it will work out. So exciting! God ways are awesome, perfect, and sometimes unexpected.

Praise the Lord! He has answered a prayer.

I'll see those of you in Flint tomorrow: I arrive at the Inn around 5:00pm.

Ryan
