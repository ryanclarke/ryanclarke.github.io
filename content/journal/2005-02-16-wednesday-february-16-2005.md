We saw many neat places in China. Many of the neat places were right close to home in Pinghu! There is a very nice lake in the town: Donghu. Here we walk along the lakefront during our first day on the town. You can see the tea house up ahead.

 In front of us and off to the right is a statue of a wise teacher of some sort. He was a a nice, big guy.

 Since China is the "Land of Enlightenment," I guess it is only normal that they kind of brag about it. They seemed to have many statues of enlightened people. Here I am sitting with another great teacher in Hangdzou (pronounced hung-joe).

 In fact, Sandy and I got quite personal with him.

 Just past the tea house in Pinghu, and a round the corner of the lake a little farther was a Buddhist Temple. I got a good picture of the ancient tower standing in the compound. The building you see to the left contained the 3 Buddhas.

 One last sight that you all may enjoy. An advertisement. I wish I was half as cool as him.
