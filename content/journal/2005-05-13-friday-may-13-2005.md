I love milkshakes. Tonight I had one cupful on vanilla milkshake. Twice. Thinking back, I probably should have only had the cupful one and a half times. But the sinking feeling is pretty good, every now and then. As a lifestyle it might get rather heavy.
 Tomorrow I go to Holland, Michigan to see the tulips. It should be fun. Not the I'm really big into flowers, but I hear there's going to be an organ concert. We'll see what happens. And what the weather's like.
