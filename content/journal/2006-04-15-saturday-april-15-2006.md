So this fun week is over.
This marks the first time that any Verity friends have visited my house (except David Prentice who visited before Verity). And not only just one friend: five came! So between the Housers and the Bushatz it was great. And I also got to see two other Verity folks: Rachel Winstead and Jen Drescher at Ft. Benning. The highlight would have to be Luke's commissioning in the Army as a Second Lieutenant. It's really neat to think of him doing all this to defend our freedom. Before too long he should be commanding his 'own' [Stryker](http://www.army-technology.com/projects/stryker/) team. Go Luke!
But the fun is not over, because tomorrow is Easter. This is always such a celebratory time in a Christian's year. Not only did Christ die to take away my sins, but he also rose to give me eternal new life. Praise Him! And I tell you what, the azaleas here in Georgia are looking incredible for this event.
