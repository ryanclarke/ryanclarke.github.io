Basically I'm reading and hanging out with my family.
 I've been doing a lot of deep thinking about who I am, who I want to be, who I should be, and why. I blame these Christian books for it. But it's a good thing to consider such things. May the Lord make me into who He want's me to be. I want my life to be none of me, and all of Christ in me.
 Read the book of James. Powerful book. Also Be Mature by Warren W. Wiersbe, which is on the book of James.
