Dear people,
 Well, yesterday was Valentines Day. At least, it was here. And only for the VOICE people. I did not celebrate the holiday, although I did get to have some leftover cheesecake from the VOICE Valentines Banquet. So that was nice. Thinking about it, the holiday that is, not the cake: thinking about it, I am reminded of a quote that is particularly apt:
 "Love - a wildly misunderstood although highly desirable malfunction of the heart which weakens the brain, causes eyes to sparkle, cheeks to glow, blood pressure to rise and the lips to pucker."

 It sounds harmful. And with that, I will leave you.
 Love, (wait a minute!)
 Ryan
