Getting ready for my trip to the Wedding-of-the-Month!
Notice that I was home at 2:00pm. Why am I out so early you ask? Because I arrived to work long before the dawn even thought about cracking. And because I'm lucky and my head boss said I could. So I'm ready to take a nap, and then pack, and then sleep, and then wake up at 4:00 tomorrow morning for the drive to PHX. And somewhere in there I'm hoping to reformat my laptop since my new 500GB external hard drive just arrived today.
I am so excited. I love vacations!
Ryan
