description: "On the other side of childhood"

On the other side of childhood   
When youth’s young bud has grown   
And some flowers it has bloomed produce   
A sprout to call their own,   
May the length of ages not induce   
What often it has wrought   
In accum'lative forgetfulness   
And stiffening of thought:   
Don’t ignore the lofty joy and stress   
A juvenile knows,   
But with lavish love fulfill the needs—   
Like rain upon the flower seeds—   
Required by each that grows.   

On the other side of childhood   
Recall where once you stood.
