Yesterday afternoon I saw this 50 year-old guy riding his four-wheeler down highway 87 through town. He was in the fast lane going 40mph passing the cars on his way to ACE Hardware. Go figure. I hope he was going to buy a helmet.
I was going to get a lot of stuff done today but all the places were closed. So instead I'm resting up for Faas to arrive on Monday.
