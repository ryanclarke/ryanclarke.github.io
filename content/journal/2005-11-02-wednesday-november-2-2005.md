Praise the Lord! I just finished Pedagogy of Harmony! I have now done all the assignments and special assignments that Dr. Kincaid has given to me. For the last half of the course I was doing very well and turning in accurate assignments that came back with rarely a mistake. So I am happy.
 I still have to write my home assignment for the test. It is a 8 measure long exercise that has to include a whole string of tricky chords and basically has to be flawless. It is a large part of the grade. Then the test is tomorrow at 8am CST. Passing is 95 or more out of 100. If I get 94.75, I fail. So I am sort of nervous. This is important. I fear dumb blunders.
 I also have to pack. Because I leave tomorrow afternoon for Flint!
 By the way, we had a nice birthday for Mr. Gothard today at lunch. Luke Kallberg and Daniel Bourne sang a very funny song about Mr. Gothard that Luke wrote. Hilarious.
