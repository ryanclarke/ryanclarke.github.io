I watched The Bridge on the River Kwai tonight. It was a great movie. There are not many movies I can recommend to anyone, but this is one. Fun, well made, and a good message (although it did honor the British at the expense of the American). Unless you object to men who aren't wearing collared shirts, you'll also find it clean. And as a plus, I liked the story, which always helps with movie enjoyability.
And that pretty much symbolizes my day: relaxed. A week's work is done. I picked up a few essentials from the store (of course, meaning Wal\*Mart), like mayonnaise and toothpaste. I cruised around looking for an apartment and found two places I'm going to inquire into this coming week. And I watched the movie. I picked it up this morning; what better way to start a weekend right than with a trip to the library!
Visiting another church tomorrow. Trying to find 'home.'
