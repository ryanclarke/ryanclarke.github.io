It was one of those days. How often have I heard that phrase? And yet I still don't know what it means. I could say it was a good day, but almost every day is a good day, so that is not saying much. I talked to Mom on the phone for over an hour, tht is always a fun thing. All you RCI people will get to meet her at Graduation. Which we won't think about, because having to leave all my friends is going to be sad. My Mom is the best.
