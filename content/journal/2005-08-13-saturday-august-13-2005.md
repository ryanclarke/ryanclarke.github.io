Dipping tater-tots in vinegar is not wierd, no matter what Fox says. I've done it all my life: learning it from my parents. It's not wierd. But it's tasty.
 Free cellphone minutes on the weekend are incredible. But I have no reason why it's like this, it is so wrong. The fact that we shoot electricity through the air and across the country in such a way that the one person we want out of millions hears exactly what we're saying hundreds or thousands of miles away is amazing. And then they give that away for free. Ridiculous. Wonderful, but ridiculous. I just love it. Now I just need to get a cellphone.
