More rosemary.
I felt considerably better today, but the rosemary was the same problem. Pulse combustion drying is a form of evaporative drying. Rosemary has lots of oil in it. Oil doesn't evaporate. So we get an oily powder, which is sticky, and likes to stick to everything in ever-growing chunks. There's no science here, we just use the old fashioned mallet to the machine to keep everything jarred loose and flowing. But some still sticks and eventually clogs up the machine. And we shutdown and tear it appear and chisel it out and it's a pain. We already fired the customer once because it's such awful stuff to dry, but they came back pleading, saying they had a new formula. And the new formula still had oil (of course) and the oil still doesn't evaporate and..... Etc. Not that it's all bad. For every 700 pounds of good powder we'll get only about 100 of hard clumps. But it's still a pain.
And an overpowering aroma. I smelled like your mom put the wrong ingredient in the Christmas cookies. Or an explosion in a potpourri factory.
Tomorrow we finish off the last 4 drums. Life's going well.
