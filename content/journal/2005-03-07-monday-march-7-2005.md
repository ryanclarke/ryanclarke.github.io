Sunday was a great day. I got to ride to church with the three Bushatz and Zach Childers. We went to Cornerstone Baptist. Most of us had never been there before, and we really liked what we saw there. The pastor is very good, he comes up with some good sermons. The music was a little weak, particularly the director: he could use some help with his beat patterns. I cannot reproduce the moves he was doing, so strange were they. After church [Luke](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=lbushatz), [Callie](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=ThePerfectWoman31), [Sandy](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=verityworkaholic), and I headed out to [A&W Rootbeer](http://www.awrestaurants.com/). I'm with Callie, I recomend the [Cheese Curds](http://www.curdcrazy.com/coupon2.htm). By the way, that's a real coupon. Of course, the iced-mug fountain rootbeer is great. It was a fun time, blending is as a Bushatz. I played some pingpong in the evening.
 Today was good also. I played pingpong this evening and won my first game ever: 21-18. Yes, I'm improving, in time for the tournament on Friday night. I'm almost finished moving into my new apartment: 628.
