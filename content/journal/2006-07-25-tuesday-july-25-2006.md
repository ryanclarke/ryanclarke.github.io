Life is good, even in large doses.
Check out this book: [The hard-core adventurer's guide to getting in, getting around and getting out of... The World's Most Dangerous Places.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Most_Dangerous_Places) It is written by [Robert Young Pelton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Young_Pelton) who has visited over 50 dangerous countries and talked with over 20 terrorist and revolutionary leaders around the world. Coauthor is Coskun Aral is a photographer who has made it in and out of Mecca alive (very rare for a photographer sine pictures are illegal), knows many warlords around the world, has been on a hijacked plane, has covered wars in over 20 counties, and is the only 9-time participant in the Camel Trophy (a race across East Africa). So it's a pretty wild book.
It's interesting that the two countries I've visited (China and Mexico) both make the book.
