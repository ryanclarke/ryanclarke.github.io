Happy Easter!
We don't need conversion. There is nothing about our old sin nature worth salvaging. We need regeneration. Only a new life will suffice. Is this new life in you? Does the power that raised Jesus from the dead on the third day live in your life and ignite the fire of your soul?
Happy Easter!
