There's this guy here who calls me "Earl." He says, "Hey Earl." So I took to calling him "Earl" also. At first I thought his name was Jimmy, but it's Matt. Everyone calls him Willie, except me, I call him "Earl." He doesn't like it I don't think. Also I hit him in the cheek with a rubber band by mistake, so maybe that's what he didn't like. Probably. But what does "Earl" mean?
 Earl: n. A British nobleman next in rank below a marquis.
 Marquis, Don: n. Humorist who wrote about the imaginary life of cockroaches.
 Cockroach: n. Formed from the two words: *cock,* the word for rooster, and *roach,* the name of a fish. Literally: roosterfish.
 So there you go.
 Summary of my day: \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*. An 8-star day. Out of 9. Pretty good.
 Here I go,
 Ryan
