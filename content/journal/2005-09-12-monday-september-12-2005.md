Beki's birthday was today. We went to Red Robin for dinner to celebrate. I always love going there. This time, the waitress at my table was about the best waitress I've ever had. It was great; a very enjoyable evening meal. Speaking of meals, I still sort of expect to see Callie going through the food line. Sadness. Anyway, Red Robin's Bottomless Fries are impossible to beat! Happy Birthday Beki! I hope 21 is the best year yet!
