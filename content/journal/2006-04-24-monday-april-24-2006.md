Torreon is 5 hours away towards the west.
We got in about midnight after a long drive with 17 people in the van. I was ready for bed. We slept in till 9 and then had a huge Mexican breakfast. We left about 11 and got in at 4. That was a beautiful drive through the north Mexican desert. Flat sand with bushes and small cacti. And the mountains are great. Rocky protrusions from the ground: huge, steep, jagged, and abrupt. Beautiful country.

Tonight we went to a traditional-style Mexican hotdog place. Good food.
