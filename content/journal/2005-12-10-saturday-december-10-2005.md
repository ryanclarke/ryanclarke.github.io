Please don't laugh. I watched the Felicity American Girl movie last night. We were having family movie night and Dad and I decided to stick it out it the spirit of togetherwiththefamilyness. Also, Mom was serving milkshakes to whoever watched it. My review: Please don't waste your time. The movie was targeted at a specific audience: namely, 6 to 10-year-old girls who don't know the meaning of "boring." It also glorifies disobedience to parents.
 I got to talk to a Chinese lady for about half an hour last night at Sarah's orchestra concert. Very fun. I have such good memories of China. And I'd love to learn Chinese.
 At 4:38pm today this blog recieved it's 10,000th hit.
