Well, class went well again today. I'm sort of falling into the groove of it. I teach morning andÂ afternoon tomorrow and afternoon Sunday. Then I start the next to classes Monday. I should be done with those the next Saturday afternoon. Then we are into the fun stuff: touring, sightseeing, shopping, and hanging around. I've got to go to dinner now. Take care.

Ryan
