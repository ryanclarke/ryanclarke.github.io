I started Pedagogy of Harmony yesterday. I have several assignments to do over this weekend. But today, I am mostly going to take a one-day break. OK, two-day counting Sunday. I need to recharge a little in the aftermath of the first course.
 Onward. We can survive in the midst of dissappointment knowing that God is in control. We can also enjoy the good times knowing God is eternal and this world means something, it's not pointless.
