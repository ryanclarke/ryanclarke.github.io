Tomorrow at 8:00am we're having the final test for Harmony 2.
I saw the most beautiful rainbow of my entire life today. We were playing ultimate frisbee out in the rain when the clearest rainbow ever appeared. It wasn't just a colory streak in the sky, it was a classic, full-color half-circle that touched the ground on both ends. And above it was another rainbow, vary faint and smeared, like a visual echo framing the brilliant arc. It was pretty neat. And God's promises hold true forever.
