I passed Biology. Praise the Lord. I was pretty scared at first. Anyway, I did a lot better than I thought I was going to do, even up to clicking "show scores." And so Sandy was successful. Blessings be upon her. Praise the Lord I'm done.
 So, you ask, what do I do with all this free time I now have? I clean my room. And play pingpong. Tomorrow I will write some music. Yes, free time is truly a wonderful thing. Unfortunately, it only last for a few short, busy days before it's over. So then, is this 'free time' really free? I don't know, but if it's referring to my feellings, then yes. I feel free. No wieghts hanging anywhere in sight.
"There is no such thing as an empty space or an empty time. There is always something to see, something to hear. In fact, try as we may to make a silence, we cannot." \~John Cage
 Another thing I think I will do is go to bed early. Oh great, it's already midnight. I guess I won't be early. Anyway, I can't have everything go my way because that wouldn't be fair to everyone else.
