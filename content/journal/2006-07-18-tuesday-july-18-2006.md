Faas's first day of work. And what a day! What a day for me too. It was a day. A lot of day.
Faas is eating ice cream for dinner. Not the low-fat kind. I'm having all-natural honey-roasted peanuts and bread & butter pickles. We're having out periodic non-health-food dinner. We haven't decided how long the period is going to be.
To rest.
