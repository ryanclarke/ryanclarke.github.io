It's great to stand outside on a 93° day as the first, huge droplets come whistling down: the really gigantic drops that feel like a freezing poke every time you are hit. And then the temperature goes down 10° in 5 minutes. It's a lovely event that happens most afternoons in August here. So... same time, same place, tomorrow, eh?
