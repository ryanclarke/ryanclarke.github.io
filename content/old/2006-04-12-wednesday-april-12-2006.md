Today we took Cameron and Gav to a local state park. We had a great time, and caught a tiny baby snapping turtle in one of the lakes. It had this mossy stuff growing all over it's shell, so when it was in water it all floated around it like it was wearing a 'fro. It's pretty funny.
Tomorrow is Luke's commissioning. That should be a neat ceremony.
