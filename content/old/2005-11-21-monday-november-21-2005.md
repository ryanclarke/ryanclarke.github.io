I have already read a book and I've started on 2 more. Looks like it could be a fun winter break. I plan to do a lot of reading, as time permits.
 I am also going to see if I can be the last Verity person to watch a movie of winter break. Which is kind of dumb, because how will I know if I succeed? But I'm going to do it anyway.
 I have limited internet. So I'll probably only be on dial-up at night.
 And Thanksgiving is soon.
