Faas and I went down to the coffeeshop tonight for a little time on the local scene. Have you seen belly dancing? I have. Now. Assuming that by "seen" you mean "winced in pain." We ordered our coffee and ran. Quite a disappointment after the awesome bluegrass family we saw last week. So now we know that the coffeeshop entertainment is like Russian roulette. And to think that Payson looks so innocent from the tennis courts...
Weekend! Fun stuff! Faas and I might head off to the World's Oldest Continuous Rodeo tomorrow.
