Thanksgiving was nice: my family and the Reckners family together. We had only planned to stay down in Parrish, Florida (near Tampa) until Monday morning. However, I heard of an opportunity to work with Bryce and Tyler Reckner for a local farmer. So, I'm still in Parrish, Florida. I'll be here for one more week. The rest of my family went home on Monday morning. It is sad to be away from my family for 2 weeks only a week after getting home from 4 months in Flint, Michigan. We are building cowpens for this farmer. There is a lot of work going into the digging holes, setting posts, and nailing boards. The cowpens are really taking shape after 5 days working 7:30 to 5. The guy who is supervising and "foreman-ing" the job looks like the Col. Chamberlain from "Gettysburg" and "Gods and Generals." He's a nice guy. And now I have a nice (large) wad of cash: money for Christmas, China, and whatever else I may need money for.
