I'm still home, of course. I still love it. Not a lot of exciting stuff has happened to me recently, but I'm still enjoying life. Sometimes slow is nice. I'm taking it easy, at least for a few days.
 Can you believe how many new buildings a small town can get in just 6 months?! And the new Super Wal\*mart going in will also sell cars and real estate. One of only 6 in the world that sells those. So there, my Wal\*mart is better than your Wal\*mart. (As if that's something to brag about.)
