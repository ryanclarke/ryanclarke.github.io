The Wilds is a lovely place.
 I played some volleyball today. It's good to know I haven't entirely lost the feel of the game. Then I went on a fairly rigorous nature walk with Boulden, Samaha, and Sarah Ness to a small waterfall (about 5ft.) and a scenic overlook (many hundreds of feet). The view looking down on a clear lake nestled in that valley as the setting sun's colors were reflected across the sky was magnificent.
 We're having some good sessions also. And they are not all music related. The talk on the power of mercy and truth being in balance was very good.
 It's a lovely place, and the food is good.
 Ryan
