Glorious Aida!
 I went to the opera Aida last night. I was incredible. With a 60-member cast and 40-piece orchestra, it was a pretty grand production. 2 hours and 45 minutes long. Although I have listened to many operas, and seen one on video, I'd never been to a live show, but what a wonderful experience it was. The singers did not use microphones; they had no need for them. The conductor was very good: his cues were excellent and his beats clear, very important in those fluid, rubato, and rhythmically varied passages that are scattered throughout opera. I didn't really like the oboe player. The Glory the Egypt chorus and march in the second half of Act 2 is a real show stopper. The set and costumes were pretty showy. Unlike the title suggests, Amneris steals the show, followed by Radam√®s, then Aida. Also there were supertitles in English providing a rough translation on a powerpoint above the stage. That was really nice to keep us all in the know about what the different people were expiring about. If you want to read a synopsis of the opera, go to this link: [Aida Synopsis](http://www.metopera.org/synopses/aida.html). I think I could get hooked on opera-going. I brought my broken pair of binoculars which were nice, but next time I'll have to buy some [opera glasses](http://www.binoculars.com/images/zhu_metro_1.jpg). It was a grand night with *good* company. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Now that's what I call a night!
