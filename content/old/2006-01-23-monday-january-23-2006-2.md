"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works." 2 Timothy 3:16-17
 Yesterday when I read that I had a sudden, fabulous insight into those verses. I realized that the four listed things that all scripture is good for are not separate items, but rather a process. Doctrine tells us the truth, reproof shows us that we're wrong, correction brings us towards the right way, and instruction in righteousness gives us the training to walk in the right way. How wonderful to think that the scripture not only does little things but is the very process whereby we become Christlike but discarding the wrong and accepting the right! May I make it through the doctrine, reproof, and correction, till I can live being instructed in righteousness!
 In other news it's Muzio Clementi's 354th birthday anniversary. If you've never played at least one of his sonatinas, you're probably not a pianist.
