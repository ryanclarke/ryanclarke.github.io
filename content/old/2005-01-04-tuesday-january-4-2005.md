Well, I guess I'm not going to get back to Flint until Monday. I woke up sick yesterday, I've got the fever. When I called Pastor Shoemaker about getting an extension till Monday, he said it was because I hadn't been taking my Ester-C (or however it's spelled). I guess I should go get some because being sick is no fun. I rather be in Flint than tossing and groaning on my bed.
