Pictures from my adventure in the mountains.
I went with some guys from church four-wheeling. We ended up getting lost and having to spend an extra day in the wild. I don't have very many picture yet, but here are a few. Here I am standing at the top of a hill we drove the trucks down. It was more like a cliff.

Here's a sample of the roads we drove on. One truck got so stuck that we had to leave it. We took everything valuable, like a carburetor, out of it first.

Hopefully I'll have better shots of the epic soon.
