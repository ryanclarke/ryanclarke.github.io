Holland, Michigan was a really neat place. They have lots of tulips there. Especially since it was Tulip Time: their annual festival. Home of wooden-shoed dancing and a 2-hour parade. Yes, lot's of tulips. And we saw an organ recital.
 People that we think we know very well often have small ideas and dreams that we would little expect from them. It's interesting how that works. Sometimes we do not like the things we find. But we can't close ourselves off from getting to know people because we might be disappointed.
