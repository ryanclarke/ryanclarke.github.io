And so I pose the question.
What's your favorite: red or triangles?
I'm teaching the youth Sunday school on (you guessed it) Sunday. I'm teaching on the great American founder whose numerous influences spread to medicine (primarily), education, prison reform, Sunday schools, Bible societies, women's education, and abolition of slavery. Yes: Dr. Benjamin Rush. He said, "I am neither an Aristocrat nor a Democrat. I am a Christ-ocrat." It should be fun.
So Byron (my house-mate) is proposing to Christy (his girlfriend) this weekend. I guess we'll see how this goes. (Actually, I think it's pretty much a given that she'll say yes.)
On a personal note: triangles.
