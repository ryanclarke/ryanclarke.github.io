Josh Wychopen and Tim Unruh came out yesterday to our work to take pictures and video of us and the plant. They're doing our new website. So they stayed over with Faas and I. Great times talking about all sorts of things. I enjoy interacting with people who are not from Payson occationally. I drove them back to the airport this morning.
It's been freezing cold here. We can see snow on the top of the Rim.
On a personal note, my toilet overflowed today. I was plunging away, and the water just kept rising. I hate it when that happens.
