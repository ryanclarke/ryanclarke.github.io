Last night after work I went over to my coworker Joseph's house and we ate pizza and watched Robots. Laughed our heads off. "Good luck with your dastardly plans."
I also got a tax document in the mail saying I miscalculated my AZ tax return. They owe me \$203 dollars more than I thought. I'm not sure how in the world I got that wrong. At least I was off in the right direction. Thank you, God, for the unexpected little boost! Because...
Today the rent is due. Again. With all the regularity of those dashed lines on the road. And Cheese-its, which are always gone the day after you open the box.
On a slightly different note. It's always fun it introduce myself to someone while I'm wearing my work uniform that has a name patch. "Hello, my name is... it's... well, yesterday... just a second... \*checks name patch\*... Hi, I'm Ryan."
I joined the choir. And everyone is still coming to church.
Ryan
