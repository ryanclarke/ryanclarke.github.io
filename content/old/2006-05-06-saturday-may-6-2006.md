What happened to the new text editor? Too many bugs? Oh well, I guess we'll get it back once they improve it.
I haven't used a weedwhacker in a long time. I forgot the feeling of getting sprayed my irregularly diced, sappy organic matter. I might have forgot the stinging, but I hadn't forgotten to wear safety glasses. I also remember, just in time, that when you hit an ant bed you want the insects spraying away from you - they pack two stings.
We had an engagement party to attend this evening. Two friends (one of each) that I've known for years have set themselves a December 16th wedding date. They're going to make a great couple, and they already do in a way. They're mature in the Lord, and are going into full-time ministry.
James 1:5 tells us that if we need wisdom all we have to do is ask God for it. He's ready and willing to give us a big dose. The only requirement is that we ask in faith, nothing wavering, otherwise we won't get anything from God. I don't know about you, but I should make it a regular habit to ask for wisdom, I know I could always use more.
