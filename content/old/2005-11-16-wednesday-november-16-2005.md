I pack stuff in boxes like a stonemason packs rocks in a wall. Taking assorted and irregular shapes, sizes, materials, and densities and fitting them into cardboard rectangles so that there is no room left over for any spare uranium. It makes for small, very heavy boxes. No wonder it takes me so long to pack: it's like I'm planning on shipping my stuff to Uranus.
 Where am I going to put it all when (if) I get it home\*?

 \*hint: not Uranus.
