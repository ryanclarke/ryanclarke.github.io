My upgraded computer is running fine. I put in a new CPU and some more RAM today. Ah, I like tweaking it to work better when I have time. My current setup is listed below:
Name: WHISTLE
AMD Athlon 64 X2 5600+ at 2.8GHz
4MB SDRAM DRR2 800 (PC2 6400)
2x nVidia GeForce 7600GT in SLI
ASUS M2N-SLI Deluxe with nForce 570 SLI MCP
2x 320GB Seagate Barracuda 7200RPM SATA 3.0GB/s
Dual-booting XP Home and Vista Ultimate
CD/DVD±RW
22" Widescreen and 19" Standard LCD monitors
I use this powerful machine to post the verse of the day on xanga:
"The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he who is wise wins souls."
       \~ Proverbs 11:30
