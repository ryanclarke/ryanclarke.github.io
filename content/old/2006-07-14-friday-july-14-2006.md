I saw this guy today who looked exactly like the solitary, old chess player from the short Pixar video. He was widely laughing as he drove by in his car.
On a personal note, I got "Not Quite As Wet As Usual" today. My technique must be improving. My feet are looking forward to being dry for a few days.
The week is done, and I'm preparing for Faas and the Faases arrival tomorrow. Also, I sketched out my plan of attack on the Payson Roundup's yardsale page map. Let's see if I can't find another man's junk, to become my treasure!
