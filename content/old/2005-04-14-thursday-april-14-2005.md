The only-ever-annual "[Ryan's Hero of the Day Award](http://www.feebleminds-gifs.com/snake-01.gif)" goes to me. I was a hero today. Don't ask me how, I just felt like a hero. Perhaps it was in relation to the way I conquered my room: it is no longer a mess. Or maybe, it truly was only a feeling. As Will Rogers said, "We can't all be heroes, because somebody has to sit on the curb and applaud when they go by." So maybe. I'm good at applause.
