The girl at the dry cleaners has a metal pimple on her nose. So I'm getting ready for the trip to the wedding.
The weather here has been mid-seventies, clear, and breezy. The forecast says much more of the same. I want to play tennis!!! Unfortunately, my [main tennis bud](http://xanga.com/sub4faast) is [out of town](http://www.pacificalumni.org/images/reno.jpg). There's a neat new guy in town, Ben, who's been coming to youth group and he's done tennis tournaments (translation: way better than me). I'm going to try to get in a trip to the courts with him sometime this week.
