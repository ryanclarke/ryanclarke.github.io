Yesterday I went shopping with my brother Ben and Grandpa Clarke. I knocked out quite a chunk of my 'people.' I found many good things. Then last night I went to a Christmas party and saw "Elf". It was dumb, which made it funny. I have a vivid imagination which helps when watching something so odd. Tonight 3 more family members arrive, as in, get here to stay for several days. Yippee. I love having the family around like this. We're going to be full!
