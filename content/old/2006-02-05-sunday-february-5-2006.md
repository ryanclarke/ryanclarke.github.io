The bus from Cornerstone came and picked us up for church. I guess up here in the north the snow prevents travel sometimes. Even though we have several inches here, I was still able to attend worship.
I watched the Super Bowl tonight. I was not very opinionated as to who I thought should win. I enjoyed watching, mostly for the party, but I was reminded again of why I don't play football. To dangerous for me.
Tomorrow the Principles ofÂ  Harmony I class begins, my trial-by-fire as a teacher. I think I'm ready: we'll find out tomorrow and the days following. Pray for me.
