The Holiday Banquet was great. The food was tasty and the entertainment was very good. Highlights include Boulden's "Do You Know This Child?" and "Great is Thy Faithfulness" on the violins. The skits were very funny.
 It was great to see Kendra again. Also, very fun having Strickler in for the weekend. Hanging out once again after all these months, like out of history.
 So, it was a very fun time all the way around. Now we're into the last week. Yay!
