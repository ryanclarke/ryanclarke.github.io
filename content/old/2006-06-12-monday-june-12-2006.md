So the weekend is over. This week I get to work five days (or maybe "have to" - we'll see as it progresses). So I'll sum up the weekend:
I got a library card.
I bought food.
I bought screwdrivers and fixed my computer. It was the same old problem: the power card came unplugged from the motherboard. Poor design by Dell. And I just spent \$43 for an unnecessary power cord. Well, that's the other design flaw on this model: a weak cord, so I might need it after all in the future. But I really do like my computer and I'm happy to have it running again. Yay!
I saw a guy who looked like he was from a '70s bike gang.
We're going to be cleaning the plant tomorrow - we have ambassadors from two companies coming in from Tuesday to Wednesday.
For those of you who read this and are prone to worry, and for my Mom, I'm not staying up too late - it's only 9:40. And I'm going to bed.
Ryan
