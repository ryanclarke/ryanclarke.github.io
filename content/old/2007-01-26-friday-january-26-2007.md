I've been working from noon till 9 or 10. I'd rather work during the day because I'm ready to go home at 5 whether I started at 8 or noon. I'm more of a morning person when it comes to working: get up, get started, get it done. Maybe the world will normalize next week. I think I'll go to bed so I don't spoil my free morning.
