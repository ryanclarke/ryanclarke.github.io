The hockey game was crazy last night. There were 4 fights and a few skirmishes. One fight was pretty big, even though it only lasted about 6 seconds. 10 guys got penalties for that one. This one guy got knocked out cold in another fight, but he woke up and was helped off the ice. And Flint lost to the Missouri team. Oh well. It was definitely a crazy game.
I'm going to the Bullinger's to have fun and spend the night.
