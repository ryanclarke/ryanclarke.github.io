In Genesis 18:32 God promised Abraham that He would not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah if 10 righteous people were found in them. Ten were not found, and so the cities were destroyed. Sometimes it only takes one man. Moses was the man who stood between the Israelites and God on numerous occasions.
I believe that those two cities were more wicked then any we have here in America, as yet. I also think that there are more then ten righteous to be found in cities across America, as yet. But there is still a need for a staunch, vibrant core standing for Jesus in cities across America.
Will you be the person who stands between God and our wicked world, beseeching God for mercy while effecting change in the society? I pray that when God looks down, I'll be one of His ten people in Payson, Arizona.
