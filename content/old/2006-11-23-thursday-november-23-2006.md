I am a generally happy guy. Of course, it's easy to be happy when there's lots to be happy about. Unfortunately, I feel that most of the year I just enjoy all my happiness but only communicate my few displeasures in life. I feel that the "5% bad" gets way more than 5% of the airtime. Mom probably knows this best of all.
So here's my Happy Thanksgiving! post containing my many and several reasons for accepting good and evil from the hand of the Lord, to quote Job. Although I'm sure you'll find more of the 'good.'
Top three things I'm grateful for this year:
3. I am grateful for God's teaching me that His plan is good. It's not always an easy lesson, but it's needed. God has orchestrated the job and life I have now perfectly. Sometimes I wish for more of this or that, or less, or for something in the future, but God keeps time at a steady pace with a constant flow of His blessing. It's enough for me.
2. Faas. My link to sanity. I'm am incurably social, and Faas is my society. Poor guy, he endures a lot. Balmy Thanksgiving, Faas!
1. I greatly appreciate encouragement and phone calls with people not in Payson, most notably Mom and Dad, but also the rest of my family, and my good friends. Without these connections to the outside, I would not survive. (Sorry Faas, but you have to put Mom at the list. That's just life.)
God is yet still good. Surprise! Um, not. What else should we expect? Let's just live like we expect God to be good.
