The first day of class went good. I think. You'd have to ask the students to be sure. We actually only had class in the morning due to the students having so many music lessons in the afternoon. Anyway, I think it went well and it's going to be a fun class.
Thank you for all you who prayed for me. Thanks and please continue.
Ryan
