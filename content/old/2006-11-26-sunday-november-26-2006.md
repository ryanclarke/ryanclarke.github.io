Four days off; very much fun.
This was my first Thanksgiving away from home. Some people from church had Faas and I over. It was a blast hanging with their family.
We spent Friday and Saturday down in Phoenix shopping, eating homemade cooking at the Drescher's, and playing mini-golf. We had great fun.
Today we finished it off with church and some creme brule.
So I commence the last 2 weeks of work for this year. Then: home!
