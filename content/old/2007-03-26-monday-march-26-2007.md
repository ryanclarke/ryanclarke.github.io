From the archives. I bumped into this little rhyme again today and figured I'd share. It was written during a lifestruggle which God used to start teaching me compassion and deference in a whole new way. I'm still not always a very other-centered person, but the Lord keeps working on me.
For many years my heart was dead:
    I did not know I even felt.
For my whole world came through my head
    Until the dizzy blow was felt.
        My reasoned life:
        Internal strife.
    My heart began to melt.
My reasoned life in order sped,
    My feelings on a dusty shelf,
And then my crystal skies turned red.
    Emotions, wild, destroyed themselves.
        How great the pain
        And weary strain!
    I weep within myself.
And thus I’m trapped with scarce release
    Between emotions and my mind.
The fearsome conflict will not cease,
    With me in front and me behind!
        My Lord will win
        And I'll give in,
    But wiser through the grind.
