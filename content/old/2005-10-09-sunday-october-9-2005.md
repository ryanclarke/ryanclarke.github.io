I went into Chicago two days in a row.
 Friday night I went in for the Double Ten Celebration hosted by the Taiwanese Economic and Cultural Office of Chicago in honor of the Tiawan idependence. It was a pretty high-class event.
 Saturday JRod, Boulden, Beeman, and I went in on the METRA train and walked around the downtown. We saw the Navy Pier, Millenium Gardens, Buckingham Fountain, and Lang Lang and Daniel Barenboim perform two piano duets in Symphony Hall. Wow, amazing building, indredible music. They played Ravel and Listz.
 Two fun days.
 Then today we went to Dr. K's church and afterwards took him and Mrs. Kincaid out to lunch at Portello's. It was a nice meal.
 Today is ending, tomorrow is coming soon, and with it, more class. It was a great weekend.
