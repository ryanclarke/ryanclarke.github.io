In keeping with the holiday spirit, I figured I'd share some secular Christmas cheer in the form of a classic Christmas song. But with different words.
[Iraqi Slay Ride](http://www.spaff.com/mp3/Spaff.com%20Iraq%20parody%20-%20Slay%20Ride%20%28%7E%20Sleigh%20Ride%29.mp3) (Dial-up warning: links to an MP3 that is 1.9MB)
Enjoy!
