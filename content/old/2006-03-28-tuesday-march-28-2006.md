So we all had to mail out at least 5 letters with Verity brochures in them to get ice cream. The ice cream was good.
Only one more chapter left in Harmony 2! Then we review for a few days. I think we're ready to bring this chapter in our lives to a close.
I also must say that both my students gave excellent speeches at Symposium. Good job Rebecca and Hannah!
