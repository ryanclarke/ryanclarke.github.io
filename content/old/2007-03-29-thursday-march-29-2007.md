My [sister Sarah](http://www.xanga.com/sarahdipityinlime) and my Dad are going go Ghana! You can keep updated on the trip from my [sister's blog](http://www.xanga.com/sarahdipityinlime), which Becky is apparently going to keep updated.
I think they're going to be teaching, in some sort of missionary-type deal. I'm not sure exactly., God bless them anyway.
 Thus proving that vacations are a slippery slope: first Kentucky, then Cancun, and now Ghana. Where will Sarah dream of to go next?
