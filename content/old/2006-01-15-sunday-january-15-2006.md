For those of you planning on attending my concert, you would be wise to reserve a free ticket for the night of your choice at 810-664-4824. The two nights, again, are Friday, Jan. 27th and Saturday, Jan. 28th, both at 7:30pm.
 I finished reading "I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist" yesterday. I guess I missed the last discussion groups or something, but I went back a read the last several chapters yesterday. It's very good book. Very logical. If Christianity really is "all truth," then it should make sense. Now I know the fallen mind sees some of it as foolishness, but basically, it should add up right in our mind. So I like a book that proves the Christianity isn't just a thing for our hearts, but also for our brain.
