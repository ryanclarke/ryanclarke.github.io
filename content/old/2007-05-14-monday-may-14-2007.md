I've been reading 1 John a lot lately. It's a small book so I've read chapters several times. John's writing makes him sound like the nicest man ever. It's amazing how kind the words sound, even though so many of them are convicting and speak strongly against sin in a Christian's life. That's how true Christianity should be, truthful but loving. Read 1 John: it's like getting a hug.
This has been Ryan, promoting a 'little book' of the Bible.
