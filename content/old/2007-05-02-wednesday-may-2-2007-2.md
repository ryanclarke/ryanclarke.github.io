In all the superhero stories, the main story element is the hero(s) superpower(s). Usually they are strong or can fly. They usually get slapped around at the beginning but end with them eventually bringing an end to evil. Through justice.
But thinking about Christ, you could say He had the most superpowers of any hero since He was God. And He was fighting against the worst of evil. And Satan slapped Him around and hung Him on a cross, but eventually brought an end to that evil. Through mercy.
Superheros kill the offender, Christ saves the offender. Which is the greater power? Hero can't change a man's heart, only Christ can.
I'm sure everyone's been asked at least once, "If you could have any superpower, what would it be?" Instead of invisibility, what about mercy and forgiveness?
Christ fed the hungry, healed the sick, and saved the sinner. That is real power.
