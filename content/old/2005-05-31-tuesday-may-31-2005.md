The last week has been incredibly busy. All the parties and then goodbyes with a big graduation in the middle have been tiring. It was just about the most fun week ever though. Now I'm leaving. I'm going to miss all of the friends I've made at Verity. Especially the people who are not coming back in July.
 I'm going to Chicago with Minna and JRod for two weeks of music theory with Dr. Kincaid. Yay! One thing, I may not be on internet while I'm there, so this may be my last post for a couple of weeks. I doubt it, but perhaps.
