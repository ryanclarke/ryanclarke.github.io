So here I sit.
 In less than a week I will be graduated.
 Strickler and I play well together on the volleyball court. Unbeatable.
 The RCI is a dry place. No water in the air. I have a crack in my lower lip. So I got some BlistexÂ® Regular Lip Balm. In a little twist out stick. I apply it to my lip at intervals throughout the day. 5 minute intervals. It works. The tube says, "keep out of eyes." \<sarcasm\>That's exactly where I'd first think to put my lip balm.\</sarcasm\> Actually the first place I put my lip balm was not on my lip. No, I put it in my right, front pocket. And the I pulled in out of the bottom of my pant leg and put it in my left, front pocket. The right pocket had a hole in the bottom.
