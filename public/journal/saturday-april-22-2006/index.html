        <p>Today we went to a real wedding. There was a girl and a guy involved. And also the Rodriguezes who were hired to provide music for the ceremony. It was a Mexican Catholic wedding, which means it was quite different than any others I&rsquo;ve seen, not that I&rsquo;ve seen many by any standard. A modern cathedral with nice architecture provide the location. The organist who hired the Rodriguezes to play with him was a musically funny guy. For about 20 minutes before the ceremony he just improvised an impressive &lsquo;piece&rsquo; that was just speckled with familiar tunes which he played to great effect utilizing all the orchestral sounds on that electric organ. There was this little guy in white scurrying around and arranging the holy trinkets before the thing, and when he can out the first time, Pacho started the &lsquo;bell theme&rsquo; which almost turned into Jingle Bells before diverting itself into the Chariots of Fire theme. It was pretty funny. So it was a neat thing to witness, the wedding being one more aspect of this different culture.
Anyway, were supposed to go to a steak cookout tonight with this family of Arabic origin that has somewhere in the vicinity of over 12 kids. It should be fun. And tasty.
