        <p>The Inaugural Address</p>

<p>I basically got this blog so I could comment on the blogs of my friends. Then I got the thinking that it might be fun to actually run the thing. As in, write stuff on it. Then all you folks who are reading this could read this. So I have started. The xanga account that I made those short weeks ago is finally rambled around into action. I guess I&rsquo;ll start with my meditation commentary from yesterday. Warning: slightly satirical subject substance.

<p>Meditation Commentary
 on John 15:5-8</p>

<p>In order to correctly interpret what Jesus is saying in verses 7-8 of John 15, we must understand the full significance of the analogy in verses 5 and 6. Many Bible scholars have traced the words &ldquo;vine&rdquo; and &ldquo;branches&rdquo; back to the original Greek words and have found out with marvelous insight that the word &ldquo;vine&rdquo; literally means &ldquo;grapevine,&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;branches&rdquo; actually means &ldquo;the branches of a grapevine.&rdquo; The scholars then explain that if you kill a branch by cutting it off it dies. These same students of Scripture go on to say that the branch mentioned in John 15:5-6 can be verified as being dead by the fact that &ldquo;fire&rdquo; in the Greek is normally translated &ldquo;fire&rdquo; meaning that the Greek word &ldquo;burned&rdquo; in verse 6 literally means &ldquo;burned with fire&rdquo; since the term &ldquo;fire&rdquo; directly proceeds the word “burned.” Then these men go on to explain that the act of &ldquo;burning with fire&rdquo; in the Jewish culture is normally understood to resulted in grapevine ashes. Ashes are lacking in all the basic attributes of life and are therefore scientifically dead.</p>

<p>This is significant to the passage since in that culture, due to the economic infrastructure that existed during the period of the Roman occupation of the Jewish land of Palestine where Jesus lived, taught, and drew His analogies, burning useful grapevine branches was uncommon. This is most likely because the economic theories existing at that time say that a person should normally not burn their livelihood for no reason. Thus these scholars deduce that the branch burned must have already been useless, otherwise, it would have never be rendered permanently useless by chopping it off and burning it with fire. Verse 6 gives us an important clue by mentioning that the burned branch in the passage was &ldquo;withered&rdquo;, meaning in the original Greek &ldquo;dried up or shriveled,&rdquo; or in other words: “withered.” The significance of this all started to make sense when we realize that the particular variety of grapevine existing in Palestine at that time produced grapes. Why? Because they were grapevines.</p>

<p>This lends even another aspect to the already impregnable arguments for the rarity of burning a live branch: cooked grapes are not as good as raw grapes (or fermented grapes). Thus, the whole idea of these grapevines is the grapes, according to what scholars tell us. This makes increasing sense when we realize that withered braches do not produce grapes. Therefore there is no reason for the withered branch to hang around when it is not doing anything useful. This is why the vinedresser lopped the branch off and committed it to the flames, or in the original Greek, &ldquo;pur&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;fire.&rdquo; He only wanted branches that produced grapes since they were better income.</p>

<p>Now that we can see all the historic and cultural implications in the analogy, we can realize the power of Jesus’ charge to us. Jesus says “Abide in me.” Even as the grapevine branch cannot produce grapes if it is not attached to the grapevine, so we cannot produce fruits of the Spirit if we are not attached to Christ. Our job as Christians is not to produce fruit. Our job is to cling to Christ and abide in Him, and he will work His fruit through our lives. Abiding contentedly and yielded is the struggle.</p>
