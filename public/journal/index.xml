      <title>The Curse of a Dream Job</title>
      <link>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/the-curse-of-a-dream-job</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No sooner does a person get a job they love then it starts to destroy them. Jesus said His burden is easy, and it is a good thing, because the ones we give ourselves rarely are. Good employees think that they have to do their best at work. And then the work expands, bringing discouragement or exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true standard: good employees should do their best in the time they are given. Companies can not own slaves. If they are buying eight hours each day, give them an honest eight. Not ten. Have something else to do with those other hours, besides sleep: develop good hobbies, invest in family. Strong family relationships take time and can not be patched together as easily as work projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good employee who has things to look forward to after work will find that he remains a good employee and has a more fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When the Frost is on the Punkin</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m loving the fall here in Indiana. I can finally understand the scenes so richly described in my favorite poem by Indianapolis&amp;rsquo; own &amp;ldquo;Hoosier Poet.&amp;rdquo; I print below the entire text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;When the Frost is on the Punkin&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Whitcomb Riley&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHEN the frost is on the punkin and the fodder&amp;rsquo;s in the shock,&lt;br /&gt;
And you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin&amp;rsquo; turkey-cock,&lt;br /&gt;
And the clackin&amp;rsquo; of the guineys, and the cluckin&amp;rsquo; of the hens,&lt;br /&gt;
And the rooster&amp;rsquo;s hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the fence;&lt;br /&gt;
O, it&amp;rsquo;s then the time a feller is a-feelin&amp;rsquo; at his best,&lt;br /&gt;
With the risin&amp;rsquo; sun to greet him from a night of peaceful rest,&lt;br /&gt;
As he leaves the house, bareheaded, and goes out to feed the stock,&lt;br /&gt;
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder&amp;rsquo;s in the shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;s something kindo&amp;rsquo; harty-like about the atmusfere&lt;br /&gt;
When the heat of summer&amp;rsquo;s over and the coolin&amp;rsquo; fall is here—&lt;br /&gt;
Of course we miss the flowers, and the blossoms on the trees,&lt;br /&gt;
And the mumble of the hummin&amp;rsquo;-birds and buzzin&amp;rsquo; of the bees;&lt;br /&gt;
But the air&amp;rsquo;s so appetizin&amp;rsquo;; and the landscape through the haze&lt;br /&gt;
Of a crisp and sunny morning of the airly autumn days&lt;br /&gt;
Is a pictur&amp;rsquo; that no painter has the colorin&amp;rsquo; to mock—&lt;br /&gt;
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder&amp;rsquo;s in the shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The husky, rusty russel of the tossels of the corn,&lt;br /&gt;
And the raspin&amp;rsquo; of the tangled leaves as golden as the morn;&lt;br /&gt;
The stubble in the furries—kindo&amp;rsquo; lonesome-like, but still&lt;br /&gt;
A-preachin&amp;rsquo; sermuns to us of the barns they growed to fill;&lt;br /&gt;
The strawstack in the medder, and the reaper in the shed;&lt;br /&gt;
The hosses in theyr stalls below—the clover overhead!—&lt;br /&gt;
O, it sets my hart a-clickin&amp;rsquo; like the tickin&amp;rsquo; of a clock,&lt;br /&gt;
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder&amp;rsquo;s in the shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then your apples all is gethered, and the ones a feller keeps&lt;br /&gt;
Is poured around the cellar-floor in red and yaller heaps;&lt;br /&gt;
And your cider-makin&amp;rsquo;s over, and your wimmern-folks is through&lt;br /&gt;
With theyr mince and apple-butter, and theyr souse and sausage too!&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to tell it—but ef such a thing could be&lt;br /&gt;
As the angels wantin&amp;rsquo; boardin&amp;rsquo;, and they&amp;rsquo;d call around on me—&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d want to &amp;lsquo;commodate &amp;lsquo;em—all the whole-indurin&amp;rsquo; flock—&lt;br /&gt;
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder&amp;rsquo;s in the shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>My Last Visit to RCI</title>
      <link>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/my-last-visit-to-rci</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2008 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/my-last-visit-to-rci</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m wandering around in the RCI. I never though this would happen again. Memories of past days are coming back and it&amp;rsquo;s been very nostalgic and fun. Volleyball in the ball room was just like I alway remember it, with the Team of Destiny chairs set up behind the nets. My old room 2628 is still set up the way JRod, Cameron and I left it, even though most other rooms are changed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept in Classroom 1 on the third floor. The only sign that Verity was even here are two office name tags that have never been removed from the wall. The lower dining room has now been set up like a living room with sofas and curtains: it&amp;rsquo;s very nice. I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in the lobby in front of the fireplace as I type this, in about the same spot that I received my Verity diploma about 2 and a half years ago. I can see the fishpond and the Mayor&amp;rsquo;s room where I taught Harmony to the &amp;lsquo;07ers and the front desk and the grand piano that Isaiah always used to play. I&amp;rsquo;m headed out now to go hear the huge organ at the First Presbyterian Church again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will never forget this place, or thing things I did here, or the people I knew here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/saturday-february-2-2008</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am back at Verity now. I&amp;rsquo;ll be here for a while as guest lecturer and assistant to the curriculum developer. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, Verity is now in Indianapolis. So it&amp;rsquo;s odd going back to my school and finding it in an entirely different state. Still this is a nice place and the guys move into the new rooms today. I&amp;rsquo;m in with the staff guys and we get an entire 5 room suite. That&amp;rsquo;s nice. It should be a good run up here. I still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten a glimpse of my sister - she was at the symphony till late last night.&lt;/p&gt;

That is shorter than the movie would be. This beats my previous (and first) record of 1 hour and 45 minutes, roughly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Listening to Andrew</title>
      <link>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/listening-to-andrew</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2008 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/listening-to-andrew</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Andrew and I went to the dump to dispose of our trash. This is what he said on our road home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew: Deers are used to the sound of cars but they don&amp;rsquo;t like cars. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that funny? Did you know that if you&amp;rsquo;re covered in spices you won&amp;rsquo;t rot? I was just thinking about that because we drove past the cemetery back there: the one with the dead people. In the old days - I don&amp;rsquo;t think they do it anymore - in the old days they used to bury people in the Pharaoh places. You know, those things. They had hallways and were big. And I was thinking: wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be funny today if they buried people in one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan: I think it would be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew: I guess so.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#39;Tis What Season...?</title>
      <link>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/tis-what-season</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2007 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/tis-what-season</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By the way, what season is it anyway? I was at Best Buy last night and I walked over to the table where they were selling the holiday gift cards. I say &amp;ldquo;holiday&amp;rdquo; with purpose. I&amp;rsquo;m not using it as a contraction of holy and day used for Christian celebrations, I&amp;rsquo;m using it as an all-purpose, non-religious term for the 25th of December, or more, Thanksgiving through New Year&amp;rsquo;s Day. (When was the last time you wished someone a happy holiday for July 4th? What about the Late Spring Holiday Season of Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day, Memorial Day, Father&amp;rsquo;s Day and Flag day?) So I&amp;rsquo;m standing at the gift card table and there are four different styles to suit everyone: Happy Kwanzaa, Happy Hanukkah, Love and Holiday (with a bride and a groom on it) and Giving Season with a gift. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a &amp;ldquo;Christmas&amp;rdquo;, a manger, or a angel to be seen. Not even a serene looking female angel with long flaxen hair and a trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I&amp;rsquo;m saying is that Christmas was a very big thing: God became man. It deserves a big celebration, and now it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even get a mention from corporate people who &amp;lsquo;know.&amp;rsquo; Sometimes it feels like they have taken the Christ out of Christmas and now they are destroying the last remnant of the X in Xmas. But I can still worship the newborn Christ, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I plan to do, whether it&amp;rsquo;s officially endorsed by Best Buy or not.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Truth and Perception</title>
      <link>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/truth-and-perception</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Dec 2007 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/truth-and-perception</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it amazes me, the incredible arrogance of our intellect. As if our thoughts create reality. There is Truth and then there is Perception. Truth is what it is, but Perception is what we think Truth is. And we think that what we perceive Truth to be is the way Truth really is. Though Truth never changes, Perception does, and the vigilant will quickly realize how transient and impaired our finite grasp of real reality is within ourselves. And thus, before we can discover Truth, we must find unerring Perception. If our feeble attempts at Perception quickly become exposed as theory and opinion, then authority can only be found outside ourself in Knowledge, which is an understanding of Truth. We cannot generate Knowledge. Therefore, we cannot find Truth in its ultimate and purest state: Truth must be given to us. Who will give us Truth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look no farther that the Bible where we find Jesus proclaimed as The Word, the very embodiment of Knowledge. We also see Jesus defining Himself as The Truth. We ask ourself, is this a legitimate claim? The answer is a resounding affirmative since in Genesis we see Jesus making everything. God was, and then He created. God made reality and truth and therefore is intimately qualified to act as the supreme interpreter. Just as truth is unusable without being perceived and perception is dangerous unless it accurately reflects truth, so correct understanding is able to unlock the mysteries of life and allow us to live purposefully and meaningfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, we must endeavor to lay aside our own thinking and the philosophies of man which surround us and immerse ourselves in the knowing instructions of our Creator contained in the Bible. What a marvelous Book, with principles that even a child can live by and the answers to mysteries that have confounded geniuses for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to believe something, I don&amp;rsquo;t need it to be easy or fair or even common-sensical, I just need it to be true, because my life depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thursday December 6, 2007</title>
      <link>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/thursday-december-6-2007</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2007 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.ryanclarke.net/journal/thursday-december-6-2007</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made it back to Georgia about 24 hours ago. Sarah and I left Arizona a week ago Thursday and 2001 miles, 7 days, and 11 states later we made it home. Of course, you may be thinking that a week is a long time for such a drive and you&amp;rsquo;re right. We stopped for a day in Kansas for Mama Shoe&amp;rsquo;s memorial service and two days in Kentucky visiting the Reckner&amp;rsquo;s. So it was a leisurely trip. The last day was the most eventful. We were hardly 5 miles from the Reckner&amp;rsquo;s when the rear passenger tire totally disintegrated. We had to unload the entire trunk to get the jack and the spare out and that when I discovered that the included jack was totally useless for changing the rear tire. Fortunately Mr. Reckner had a bottle jack and was able to help me get changed to limp into town and get a new tire. It took a while so we didn&amp;rsquo;t head for home until mid-afternoon. But we&amp;rsquo;re back and it&amp;rsquo;s great to be with family again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the next step, whatever it is. All this has kept me crushingly busy so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably take a short breather and then start pursuing my future again with anticipation. There are these little dreams we all have, and maybe some of mine will start to come true. By &amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo; dreams, I mean those impossibly magnificient ideas that we harbor so close to our soul until they become a living part of us. Life isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy, but it&amp;rsquo;s terribly exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The wedding was amazing. I have spent the last few days at home and now we&amp;rsquo;re all headed up to North Carolina for Thanksgiving. Here&amp;rsquo;s wishing you all a happy Thanksgiving and a grateful heart.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m headed east! I&amp;rsquo;m spending a day at Verity before heading down to my good friend Bryce&amp;rsquo;s wedding where I&amp;rsquo;ll be the best man. Then I spend the whole following week and Thanksgiving with my family. This is going to be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I cooked myself a nice, juicy, ribeye steak last night after marinating it for 3 days. And I had mashed potatoes. I just figured I&amp;rsquo;d let you all know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met the girl who&amp;rsquo;s dad painted the Herbie in my town. Her name was Emerald.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like Intel is going to phase out their single-core processors at the beginning of next year. Only dual- and quad-core will be available. And I doubt AMD will hold onto single-core much longer. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the consumer-priced quad-core 45nm PSUs that Intel has coming next February, although I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;ll get one. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely an interesting time on the PC hardware front as we&amp;rsquo;re finally starting to see the effects of Vista on hardware design. (That statement is not completely true, but that&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable consumer perspective on the trend.) Also, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntu.com/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu 7.10&lt;/a&gt; just came out yesterday. I&amp;rsquo;m downloading it today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1111 days bloggin for me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Pastor Allen gave me a gift certificate to the Phoenix Symphony in appreciation for me filling in for him these last two weeks. I was quite surprised on top of happy. Of all the perfect gifts! So, now I just have to decide what I want to see&amp;hellip; and who to bring with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just a few hours I head to the church to begin my long weekend with the youth. We drive through the night, spend Saturday at Magic Mountain riding coasters, Sunday morning at the beach freezing in the water, and then we drive and get back Sunday night. It&amp;rsquo;s 8 hours to Santa Barbara. And 8 hours back.&lt;/p&gt;
