        <p>Class is officially over. The final exam is officially over. We are officially done. At 9 am we&rsquo;re all going back to the Staff Center, where we&rsquo;ve had all the classes, so that we can get our grades from Dr. Kincaid. Since I finished the test first and turned in my papers first, Dr. Kincaid started grading my first. He gave me my score back before he left. And I got a 97. A note on Dr. Kincaid&rsquo;s grading: he was very upset with me the time I got 93 last September. He seemed fairly pleased when he gave me this 95, and then when I contested one of the answers he marked wrong, he was very happy that I got a 97. He just made a simple mistake grading. And the 3 points I lost were just a dumb mistake also, I answered a question about themes with an answer about motives. So he knows I know all the material well, so that makes him happy. He is an amazing teacher. I don&rsquo;t think I could do nearly as well with someone else. The tests are very hard, but not very difficult for us because he has so well prepared us for them.
 I&rsquo;m happy.
 Except that my computer is still dead. Actually, the battery can still power it, so I got Kristin to charge my battery for me because she has the same model computer. Then I used 5 of the 20 minutes my battery gives me to retrieve some important files from my computer. Files I nee to use. So that is good.
