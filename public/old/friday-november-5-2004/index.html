        <p>And so, I haven’t updated once yet. But that I intend to rectify that.</p>

<p>Just after I posted that first entry, I went on the Verity Guy’s Camping Trip to the Yurt Village of Lake Ann Baptist Camp in Empire, Michigan. Which means “rain and sand.” Really &ldquo;yurt&rdquo; comes from the Turko-Russian word &ldquo;yurta&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;shack&rdquo; or &ldquo;shanty.&rdquo; The original Mongolian word for their peculiar shelter is &ldquo;ger&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;home.&rdquo; Anyway, it was actually very fun. I was in the most fun (unsubstantiated) and most spacious (a proven fact) van the whole trip. I was also in the Yurt that played Rook for 5 hours at a stretch each night. So I learned how to play, and enjoyed it alot. We also played paintball, and that was fun because I got to shoot up my boss. By the way, a yurt (ger):

<p>From Monday morning until Friday evening my sister Sarah was here in Flint. It was really great to have a family member to sit with at meals. She was also here for the election. I stayed up until 3:00am watching FOX News and feverishly pressing the refresh button on CNN.com to get the latest 8 digit-numbers and color-code maps. It was very fun cheering my way through a historical experience with a group of close friend and, of course, my sister. And Bush won the election which was an answer to prayer. Marriage amendments passed, good senators and congressmen were elected, Daschle was ousted, and the best thing: Kerry had the decency to yield the race so there will be no “litigation carpet-bombing” to rend the nation for months to come. Praise the Lord for that!</p>

<p>This week I also continued on my quest for a degree by taking the English Composition with Essay CLEP. I took it this morning at 8:30am. I feel good about it, both the questions section and the essay section. My essay topic was a little easier to think of material to write about than I was expecting, which was a very nice surprise. I sat next to Chuck who was taking the same test, and we high-fived before we started, which undoubtedly helped since he feels good about the test also. However, the keyboards on the testing computers are not particularly luxurious, and the keys sound like seashells falling into a bucket of nickels. And we’re not supposed to sneeze in there to keep from distracting the other testers. Go figure.</p>

<p>And that’s all for now.</p>
