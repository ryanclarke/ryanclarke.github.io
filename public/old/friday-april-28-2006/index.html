        <p>I corrected it in last night&rsquo;s post. We saw the other Monterrey soccer team play last night. Not Rayados, but the Tigres. They wear yellow (or gold) and blue. They were playing a team from Paraguay.
We arrived early for the game and saw the Tigres bus drive in. Once inside we sat waiting for about an hour for the game to start. By the time the game actually started, all the folks in the crazy corner were worked up into a fever of excitement. They had a loud bass drum and a pitiful trumpeter, and to the tune of that &lsquo;duet&rsquo; they sang, more like chanted, their &lsquo;songs&rsquo; all the whole game. One of their songs (translated by JRod) went in part like this. &ldquo;You give us joy in our heart. You know what we&rsquo;re feeling. We love you.&rdquo; Sound&rsquo;s sort of like a Praise &amp; Worship chorus. And most of the time they were jumping up and down. Notice how well they decorated their section with the blue and yellow banners. The white stuff is the confetti that they all threw when the Tigres ran into the arena.

And the athletes played their hearts out. Especially in the first half when they still had a heart to play out. Some guys got hurt, so they&rsquo;d drive their funny little golfcart ambulance out to check the problem. This particular contestant they drove off in a stretcher, but once they reached the edge, they made him walk the rest of the way to the bench. So I guess he wasn&rsquo;t hurt bad.

It started raining halfway through the game, but we went prepared with the van&rsquo;s windshield sunvisor thing. It worked.

Today we went hiking. We did part of the Chipinque. It&rsquo;s one of the mountains around Monterrey. Just JRod and I went. It was pretty foggy, giving us some beautiful pictures.

We stopped for a rest halfway up.

But we continued on and made it up and back down. It was very foggy near the top.

On the way down the sun came up melted a lot of the fog away and we were able to get a view of the city. At the base of Chipinque are a lot of nice, big homes. We were almost to the bottom before we could see all this. Notice: a lamp post in the wood.

Afterwards, we took a taxi to this very nice Mexican buffet were we stuffed ourselves. The food was great. I&rsquo;m going to miss some of the food here. I leave to go home tomorrow morning about 11. It&rsquo;s been a very fun vacation. And the Rodriguezes are great folks to hang out with. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed spending time with their entire family, except of course Cristina.
But it will be good to return home.
