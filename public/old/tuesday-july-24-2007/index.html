        <p>I get really mad today. Which is surprising since I&rsquo;m a really easy going person and not much shakes me in that way. I can&rsquo;t remember being mad for months, and then I&rsquo;m fuming. It was kind of scary: I was seconds away from saying some imprudent things. As 1 Corinthians 10:12 says, &ldquo;Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.&rdquo; Fortunately I took heed and called my Mom where she was able to get my mind back on good things (Philippians 4:8).
It&rsquo;s interesting that 1 Corinthians 10:12 is proceeded by some verses on the Israelites in the desert in verses 1-11. &ldquo;&hellip; brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and did eat the same spiritual meat; and did drink the same spiritual drink: for the drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. But with many of them God was not pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. &hellip; Neither be ye idolaters &hellip; commit fornication &hellip; tempt Christ &hellip; murmur &hellip; as some of them &hellip; and were destroyed of the destroyer. Now these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.&rdquo; Then finally, &ldquo;Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.&rdquo;
And it&rsquo;s so easy to get caught up in Christless actions and attitudes. Take heed. I got a big warning today. Thank God for Mom!
