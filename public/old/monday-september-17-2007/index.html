        <p>I saw Herbie again and I still haven&rsquo;t managed to take a picture. Yeah, he lives in my town.
I played a little paintball today and I&rsquo;m happy to report that my gun, with it&rsquo;s new low-pressure mod (that I finally completed), performed admirably and I&rsquo;m quite happy with the improvement. Not that you care, but you might be interested to know that I shot about 5 balls into the trunk of my car by mistake. Fortunately I hit some other paintball stuff in there so my fine gray carpet (I guess that what you call it) is not a mysteriously tie-dyed design like I had feared. &ldquo;Fear&rdquo; is probably a harsher term than necessary for my peculiar emotion: &ldquo;surprised &lsquo;huh&rsquo;-ness&rdquo; would be a more exact term. I&rsquo;m just glad it didn&rsquo;t happen to Herbie. Needless to say, since I was the winner of that little duel it had to carry me home.
I took the final test for my evangelism training class. It was a very long handwritten test. By the end of it I was so cramped that my handwriting was changing styles faster than women&rsquo;s clothing. It didn&rsquo;t help that I keenly felt the pressure of time.
Maybe I&rsquo;ll wake up tomorrow and my cold will be gone. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be exciting!
