        <p>Hi everyone, I¡¯m in China. Here¡¯s an update.\</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>The Journey</strong></p>

<p>**** </p>

<p>I woke up on Monday morning at 3:00am, showered and went down to the lobby of the RCI. We left at 4am. The drive was long and cold. The heater in my van did not work. So we drove through the cold Michigan-Indiana-Illinois night shivering. When we got to Chicago, the highway got stopped up so we pulled of for a detour. Unfortunately, only the first half of the detour was marked. So we ended driving down this back road, 50<sup>th</sup> street, until we got to the Latino district. There we turned onto this bigger road to go back and find the other highway. We found ourselves in a Chinatown. I hopped out and asked directions from a oriental guy who barely spoke English. His directions were wrong, but we found a different road going to the airport. The other vans didn¡¯t have the same problem so everyone was waiting for us at O¡¯Hare. The first 6 hour leg of the expedition was over.</p>

<p>At O¡¯Hare airport we all got our tickets and passports checked. Then we went through security without a hitch. At the gate we sat around for an hour and a half but nobody slept because we were all so excited. At about noon we loaded the United flight 835, a Boing 777, for Shanghai, China. We were all sort of spread out in the back section of the plane, but we were mostly in rows of 2 to 5, so it was OK. I sat next to Sandy Bushatz for the first portion of the flight. The flight was about 15 hours long. In the back of each seat was a little screen so we watched some movies. But sitting got tiring. So we also stood and walked up and down the aisles and stood around in groups talking. I even played cards with some folks for a while. I tried to change people I was sitting next to every so often just to get different company. The plane took the ¡°great circle route¡± to China. We headed almost straight north from Chicago. Out the window I was able to see many wondrous sights. I saw Hudson Bay, the Northwest Territory, those islands up north of mainland Canada, the Arctic Ocean, Siberia, and Mongolia. We were to far north to see Alaska. The northern reaches of Canada were amazing: frozen lakes and hundreds of miles snow with gigantic cracks running for miles. The Arctic Ocean even looked cold. I estimate that we were north of the 80<sup>th</sup> parallel for part of the trip. The airplane screen said that the outside air was ¨C98 degrees Fahrenheit! Siberia was rugged, white mountains: millions of acres of untouched snow, ice, and rock. The part of Mongolia I saw was about the same as Siberia. During the trip we started with the sun at about noon and ended with it at about 5pm, so we stayed with it the whole trip. It did get dark for a while when we were so far north the sun couldn¡¯t reach us. We crossed the International dateline, so immediately it was the next afternoon. It was kind of weird knowing that I just lost a whole day, a whole 24 hour night that I will never experience. So after almost 16 hours we made it to China and landed in Shanghai. It was 5:40 local time. The longest leg of the trip was over.</p>

<p>The first thing that happened in China was getting into the country. We had to fill out and sign two forms full of information and give my passport to two different people. The Chinese officials do not wear nametags; they were shiny silver pins that have their number on it. So dehumanizing. Then we picked up our luggage. Side note: the Shanghai airport in huge, when it¡¯s finished it will be the biggest in the world; they¡¯ve been building it for years. Joe Martin and Eddy Thompson picked us up at the airport. We rode to Pinghu in a big bus with soft seats and big windows to see the sights. The Chinese work around the clock, so all the under construction buildings were under construction. It was one and a half hours to Pinghu, and I made it fine, sleeping for most of it since I did not sleep on the plane. We got to Pinghu Compassion High School at 8:00 after traveling for 28 hours straight. The journey was over.</p>

<p><strong>Pinghu, China</strong></p>

<p>**** </p>

<p>My room is pretty nice. I¡¯m rooming with Jrod, just like at Verity. We have no toilet paper, but we do have a TV, fridge, microwave, and bottled water machine with the 5 gallon bottle. The room is pretty small. The floors are cold. I slept from 9pm to 6:30am. It was very restful. Jrod and I showered and walked over to the building where we have a room that we meet in. Breakfast was good: banana, orange, hot chocolate, and a roll of what I called ¡°Prince¡± because that was the only word that was in English. (Yes, almost everything here is in Chinese.) Princes were two crackers that had chocolate between them. Then we had some training and learned about what we were going to do for the next three weeks. At 10:00 we went for a tour of Pinghu. It was very neat and weird and new and I converted $40 into 328.60 RMBs but I haven¡¯t bought anything yet, and I¡¯ll have to write later because it in dinnertime here now.</p>
