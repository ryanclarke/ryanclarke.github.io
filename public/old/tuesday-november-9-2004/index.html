        <p>Nope, not a geek
I went across the hall to Peter and Paul&rsquo;s room tonight to get my geek lesson. Actually it&rsquo;s an informal thing where I go see what wonders Paul is performing on his laptop. Tonight Paul was quizing me with multiple choice questions off the Windows 2000 MCSA certification exam. (Don&rsquo;t ask me what MCSA stands for.) I got one question right; and the other right also, on the third guess (out of four). So, I&rsquo;m a certified &ldquo;non-geek.&rdquo; In computers at least. But I&rsquo;d like to think I could hold my own in music theory and music history.
 Yes, I have better success with music. Tonight I conducted the Verity Chamber Orchestra in a piece that I composed and which we will be playing at the recital on Friday night. I actually made it the whole way through the piece, twice, without managing to throw of the entire ensemble. Sweet victory. I stood in front of a mirror with Tristan&rsquo;s camcorder running and my computer playing a MIDIized version of the piece for a hour tonight and flapped my arms like a bloomin&rsquo; idiot. I then had video footage of a guy trying to fly in a dormroom, complete with soundtrack. I felt like shooting the mirror. Actually, I felt like <em>not</em> shooting the mirror, but instead conducting towards a blank wall where I wouldn&rsquo;t have instant reply of every mistake. That way I&rsquo;d have time to justify my errors before facing reality in Tristan&rsquo;s digital wonder. But, by throwing cues at a nightstand and passionately crescendo-ing a windowsill, I managed to get a hang of my left hand. Hint: it is very handy for a conductor to know where is left hand is at all times, especially when conducting. (that sounded like I was trying to crack a cheesy pun: &ldquo;handy&rdquo; &ldquo;hand&rdquo;, but I wasn&rsquo;t) And then it was 8:20pm, orchestra practice time. And I managed to totally confuse 12 fine musicians for 10 minutes before they finally played the piece two times beautifully, and I managed to stay with them. Victory. One more rehearsal till shownight &hellip; and I need it more than the performers! It&rsquo;ll be my grand debut as a conductor!
 And with that, I will go to bed.
