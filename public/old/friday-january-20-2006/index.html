        <p>I painted the backside of the house, the wall with the deck, this afternoon. I haven&rsquo;t painted on the house for a year and a half. It was good to go out and slap some color on. And the weather was fair.
 I came up here into the big town of Carrollton, Georgia to the Gallery Row coffeeshop, right on the town square, as is becoming my Friday custom, I guess. Sarah and Rebecca come here Fridays 4:00PM-6:30PM and meet up with friends and play games. I ride along, and take advantage of the high(er)-speed internet. Today I&rsquo;m using it to do music history quizzes for my TESC portfolios, because (Praise the Lord!) I finally heard back from my advisor on Wednesday.
 One year ago today the Verity &lsquo;05 class visited the Mo house built during the Ting Dynasty. I also was part of a smaller group that visited the tall tower and attached Buddhist temple in the background of the picture in the last post. I took my second rickshaw ride, they were really fun.
 I am experiencing an ever more and more escalation of excitement about my symphony concerts one week from today! See some of you there!
