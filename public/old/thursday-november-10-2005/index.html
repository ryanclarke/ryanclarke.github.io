        <p>Soccer was great. I was out of practice, but had a lot of fun. And now I&rsquo;m somewhat sore in my legs.
 They brought a man with palsy to Jesus and He said &ldquo;Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.&rdquo; (Matthew 9:2c) My question is: was the man of good cheer after Jesus forgave his sins? Jesus didn&rsquo;t physically heal him until later when he did as a demonstration against the scribes. He healed the guy and the guy went home. No emotions are recorded in this account other than that the crowds went wild at the healing and that the scribes were obviously displeased with the whole ordeal. But what about that man? Was he of good cheer when Jesus forgave his sins? Or was he not of good cheer until Jesus healed him? I don&rsquo;t know. There are two states of existence: God as king or self as king. All sin in it&rsquo;s base form is self as king. I want to fully believe that sin is worse than any illness because it dethrones God in His rightful place in my heart. Any external polishing or etiquette is of little worth if I leave a little sin inside that &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t hurting anyone.&rdquo; Sin killed Jesus. Sin kills us. Sin is serious, may I never take it lightly. May I be of good cheer because I&rsquo;m forgiven of my sin, and be of good cheer as I gain victory over the resident sins Jesus shows me.
 This school break, more than any other previous school break, I am ready to go home. I want to see Dad and Mom and Ben and Sarah and Rebecca and Lydia and Andrew!
