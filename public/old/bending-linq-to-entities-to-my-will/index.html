      <h1 class="title">Bending Linq-to-Entities to my will</h1>
      
      <div id="post">
        <p>I am building an ASP.NET MVC 4 application using Entity Framework as my ORM on top of an existing SQL Server database. This is model-first, not code-first. I am fairly new to Linq-to-Entities. Recently I ran into something that gave me many problems and I had great trouble finding any help online. I&rsquo;ve now solved it, twice. This is my story. I have a view that need to display a list of Modules (as in, classroom teaching). Each Module belongs to a Unit, but each Unit can have many Modules. Each Module can have multiple Instructors, and each Instructor can teach many Modules. There is a ModuleInstructor table to join that relationship. Unit -1:N- Module -N:1- ModuleInstructor -1:N- Instructor EntityFramework has these for objects [unnecessary properties trimmed for brevity]:
Anyway, I wanted to display: UnitName, ModuleDate, Instructor(s) in a comma-separated list. My problem was that I had the hardest time getting Linq to get the Instructors, all I could retrieve was the ModuleInstructors which didn&rsquo;t have any of the Instructor information loaded.
My first solution was to modify the Module class to add another collection:
In the ModuleController I got everything except the Instructors, then the Instructors separately and for looped through inserting them into the collection.
According to LinqPad this take two SQL statements. Not too bad. It&rsquo;s not that much of strain on the server either because I don&rsquo;t have many Instructors and there are only 20 Modules being shown at any one time. However, I figured there must be a way to do it in one database call. Here&rsquo;s my new solution. I still loop through inserting Instructors into the Modules object&rsquo;s Instructor collection, but I get all the Instructors with everything else.   According to LinqPad it takes only SQL statement and it performs slightly faster that the first method. To be perfectly honest, I have trouble picturing exactly how this works and why, but it does. I am very happy that I stuck with the problem, coming back to it several times more until I got it &ldquo;just right.&rdquo; My one question: is this the best way to do this or is there a still better way? Maybe I&rsquo;ll never know, but at least it&rsquo;s better that it was before.
