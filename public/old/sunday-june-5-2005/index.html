        <p>JRod and I are staying in a house here in Chicago. There are two other guys that live here. One is gone for the week and the other is not gone for the week. The guy who&rsquo;s here is called John, I&rsquo;m assuming that&rsquo;s his name. At least, &ldquo;JWL&rdquo; are the initials he has on his medicine bottles. So, he had a friend over yesterday that that answered to the name &ldquo;Ryan.&rdquo; This Ryan had a wife. He also had kids judging from all the hollering in the background when he talked to his wife on the cellphone. And the two of them got into this internet contest. John and Ryan, that is. Together. The idea was if they could write a computer program in 24 hours that was better than the other 121 team&rsquo;s programs, then they would get a &ldquo;fat prize&rdquo; and &ldquo;lots of prestige.&rdquo; I went to bed before midnight, so I don&rsquo;t know if they won, or even submitted their thing before the deadline. I hope they won.
 In other news: we&rsquo;re still pushing our way through Franck&rsquo;s Symphony in D Minor. Pretty amazing stuff.
