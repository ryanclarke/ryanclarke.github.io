        <p>Well, here at HQ we celebrated Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day in fine style. Having never celebrated it before, I don&rsquo;t feel the liberty to call him Ol&rsquo; Paddy. Anyway, we had corned beef and cabbage and potatos for lunch. and afterwards a couple of laddies hopped up and sang a funny Irish song. It made fun of the religious differences in Ireland with the northern Protestants (and the Scottish) being orange and the southern Catholics being green. Knowing that, I&rsquo;ll wear orange next time. I have a little Irish blood in me, but the highlands of Scotland are where I really come from.

 <strong>The Orange and the Green</strong>
<em>words and music by A. Murphy</em>
 My father was an Ulster man, proud Protestant was he.
 My mother was a Catholic girl, from county Cork was she.
 They were married in two churches, lived happily enough,
 Until the day that I was born and things got rather tough.
    Chorus:
    Oh, it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen.
    My father, he was Orange and me mother, she was green.
 Baptized by Father Riley, I was rushed away by car,
 To be made a little Orangeman, my father&rsquo;s shining star.
 I was christened &ldquo;David Anthony,&rdquo; but still, inspite of that,
 To me father, I was William, while my mother called me Pat.
 With Mother every Sunday, to Mass I&rsquo;d proudly stroll.
 Then after that, the Orange lodge would try to save my soul.
 For both sides tried to claim me, but i was smart because
 I&rsquo;d play the flute or play the harp, depending where I was.
 Now when I&rsquo;d sing those rebel songs, much to me mother&rsquo;s joy,
 Me father would jump up and say, &ldquo;Look here would you me boy.
 That&rsquo;s quite enough of that lot&rdquo;, he&rsquo;d then toss me a coin
 And he&rsquo;d have me sing the Orange Flute or the Heros of The Boyne
 One day me Ma&rsquo;s relations came round to visit me.
 Just as my father&rsquo;s kinfolk were all sitting down to tea.
 We tried to smooth things over, but they all began to fight.
 And me, being strictly neutral, I bashed everyone in sight.
 My parents never could agree about my type of school.
 My learning was all done at home, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m such a fool.
 They&rsquo;ve both passed on, God rest &lsquo;em, but left me caught between
 That awful color problem of the Orange and the Green*
