        <p>The choir men sang the special during church today. It was a killer-hard 3-part men&rsquo;s piece. But after several weeks of practice we pretty much had it nailed and it came off well. We got tons of compliments and I even got 3 about my voice in particular. What can I say: I sing loud. So maybe my voice is improving into a viable, public-use instrument of praise.
We played paintball this afternoon. It&rsquo;s always a blast. We played 4 games with 4 on 4 teams. Out of the 18 total eliminations made by both teams today, I shot 9 of them. I must have been on a roll. And I&rsquo;m tired from running up and down the sides of the dirt gullys.
By the way, my listening on Wednesday night worked. The guy managed to talk himself into doing the right thing. He knew the truth and he was having trouble seeing it because of a few bad days: and I listen to him talk himself into the right. It&rsquo;s amazing how that works.
