        <p>I was talking to my brother Ben on the phone today. I love him, I mean, he&rsquo;s my brother after all. But I&rsquo;m proud of him too. With my parents I definitely love them. But I think with my siblings pride trumps love. I guess it&rsquo;s part of being the oldest.
Ben can play circles around anyone on a clarinet.
And he can certainly outdo me on the piano.
He sings better.
He can light me up in paintball.
He&rsquo;s better with animals.
He can be with people who are acting totally foolish and not lose his composure.
He&rsquo;s stronger.
I think I&rsquo;m still faster though.
And I always could make a better bow and arrow.
Be he was a better archer.
He can fix an engine.
He can build a house. I&rsquo;m sure.
But I was a better Legos builder.
He can run an entire week-long day-camp for inner-city Atlanta gang kids all summer.
He is the best foosball player I know.
He can pass advanced calculus his first semester at college, and he was the one who hated math.
He&rsquo;s a hard worker.
And no, it&rsquo;s not his birthday. I just felt like telling the world, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my brother.&rdquo;
By the way, my sister Sarah had a violin solo at some big concert tonight. Wish I could have been there.
