        <p>Well, I promised more. Yesterday night I was very tired. I felt drained. For years my Mom would occasionally complain about continuously giving energy and never getting any back and how she was so exauhsted. I never really bought her story. Now I know what she meant: emotional energy. I&rsquo;m not really an emotional person, but repeatedly giving hours of each day teach kids and counseling friends can get tiring. JRod really helps me recharge, and he&rsquo;s gone this week in Ningbo. I just got so tired I went to sleep really early. I went down at 8:00pm.
 This morning I woke up at 6 and walked around in the cold, I feel great. Taught this morning. It&rsquo;s great teaching, I kind of think it&rsquo;s fun, but it gets tiring for sure. Over the last three days I&rsquo;ve taught 26 3rd graders the whole concept of plural. In Chinese there is no plural. It was tricky, but I won. The poor kids just about fried their brains. Now they can say &ldquo;This is a &hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;That is a &hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;These are &hellip;s.&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Those are &hellip;s.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m kind of proud of myself. I didn&rsquo;t do anything yesterday other than go out for a nai cha (milk tea) at night. I just took it easy. I planning on going out tonight for dinner with some folks. So we&rsquo;ll see.
 Tomorrow is the last day of class. I&rsquo;m on the home stretch. Then a few days of touring and we leave. I&rsquo;ll be sad to leave China, but it&rsquo;ll be nice to actually TALK to my family again and not just email.
