        <p>One of the fun things at The Wilds was Funtime. It was about an hour of solid skits and funny stuff done by members of the staff. One guy got up and did a fairy tale using spoonerisms. It was a enhanced version of Sleeping Beauty. Boulden, Samaha and I thought it was hilarious. So we all posted in as our taglines, except Boulden, yet. Good memories. We three wise men from Verity, all from different years.
 Another part of Funtime, they sang this song:
 If My Nose Was Running Money
 Mike Snider
 You say that I don&rsquo;t love you. You say my love is untrue.
 Well darlin&rsquo; if I was a rich man I&rsquo;d prove my love to you.
 I&rsquo;d buy you a diamond ring and a new fur coat or two.
 If my nose was running money honey I&rsquo;d blow it all on you.
 - If my nose was running money, I&rsquo;d blow it all on you.
 - I&rsquo;d buy you a Cadillac and a new Mercedes too.
 - I&rsquo;d build you that mansion up on the mountaintop.
 - I wish my nose was running money but it&rsquo;s snot.
 If my nose was running money, Let me tell you what I&rsquo;d do.
 I&rsquo;d buy you a John Deere tractor and we&rsquo;d get rid of that old gray mule.
 I&rsquo;d carry you down to the store and buy you a brand new pair shoes.
 And you not have to be plowing bare footed the way you always do.
 If my nose was running money, We could have anything we please.
 The first time you wanted cash all I&rsquo;d have to do is sneeze.
 Why we&rsquo;d be living high on the hog and the hog wouldn&rsquo;t be so lean.
 If my nose was running money honey we&rsquo;d be rollin&rsquo; in the green.
 It&rsquo;s a booger of a problem that I got.
 I wish my nose was running money but it&rsquo;s snot
 I&rsquo;d buy you a Cadillac and a new Mercedes too.
 If my nose was running money, I&rsquo;d blow it all on you.
 If my nose was running money, I&rsquo;d blow it all on you.
