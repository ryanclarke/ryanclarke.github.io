        <p>Today was not what you would really call a good day.
 Sarah Ness left after only two short days here. I found out that my Symphony No. 2 is not going to be performed next week, it is pushed back to January. A plan that I had fell through. I felt tired all day. I have a project hanging over my head. I forgot about park night and came down to late to get a van.
 Nope, today couldn&rsquo;t really be called a good day.
 But I got two goals in soccer, a gift for someone, and an encouraging thank-you note. Yes, there is joy in doing, joy in giving, and joy in being appreciated. These little blessings allowed me to keep a smile on today.
 It might not be a good day by most standards, but, I guess, looking back, to me, it was a good day. Because even the &lsquo;bad&rsquo; things had good in them.
 Sarah Ness left after only two short days here <em>(but she came, and I got to see her!)</em>. I found out that my Symphony No. 2 is not going to be performed next week, it is pushed back to January <em>(but a real symphony is going to play my music!)</em>. A plan that I had fell through <em>(but it was not going to work out that great anyway!)</em>. I felt tired all day <em>(but I got a good nap!)</em>. I have a project hanging over my head <em>(but it is a very interesting project!</em>). I forgot about park night and came down to late to get a van <em>(but fortunately Garret came by on the way to the park from an errand and picked me up!)</em>.
 Today was a good day.
