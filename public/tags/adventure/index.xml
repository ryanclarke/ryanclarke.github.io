      <title>True Adventure</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“True adventurers have never been plentiful. They who are set down in print as such have been mostly business men with newly invented methods. They have been out after the things they wanted—golden fleeces, holy grails, lady loves, treasure, crowns and fame. The true adventurer goes forth aimless and uncalculating to meet and greet unknown fate. A fine example was the Prodigal Son&amp;ndash;when he started back home.” ~O. Henry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That paragraph from &lt;em&gt;The Green Door&lt;/em&gt; captures the essence of the Christian Adventure. Life is designed to require faith and the life of faith is an Adventure. For some years now I have felt called by God to go to China and learn the Chinese language and I think, “Won’t living in China be an adventure!” However, China is not the Christian Adventure. The Adventure is feeling and following the call of God when it looks impossible. It is desperately caring about the success of a situation when it is shadowed by certain failure in human terms. It is diving whole-heartedly into vague visions of the future when there is no earthly way that it will all work out. It is stepping into the Jordan River in hopes that God will dry it out. The Christian Adventure cannot be separated from prayer: kneeling in the darkness night after night and begging God for direction, begging Him for faith, begging for peace and confidence and contentment and joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Christian Adventure is being willing to calmly follow God into crushing trials because He has promised to never leave me and to work everything together for my good. It is passionately living under the will of Divine Benevolence. Do I have to go to China for adventure? No, I am living the Adventure now. And it just might be that the Adventure will lead me to China. God knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rest my unknown future on Christ who died for me. That is True Adventure and I am a True Adventurer!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>This is My Thanksgiving</title>
      <link>http://ryanclarke.github.io/post/this-is-my-thanksgiving</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2007 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ryanclarke.github.io/post/this-is-my-thanksgiving</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been blessed with a good life. Throughout my journey, God has never ceased to shower all manner of sweet providence along my way. Many good things have happened to me that I have had no control over, from the dynamic family I was placed in to the amazing resilience of my fearfully made person.  And then, in love, God gently and surely called me to be His own and bought me with his blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My God has lead my steps, even when I was not consciously aware of His work. At other times when I cried for guidance and direction as I anxiously awaited looming deadlines and decisions, He has never failed to reveal His perfect and often unexpected will even if it may appear to be only at the last minute. Because of this long history of faithfulness to me, I can confidently approach the future with peace that it is in His hands. My present state of uncertainty has only worked to make me more excited about the possibilities ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new adventure started on Monday, November the 12ᵗʰ.  I had just arrived home the weekend before from a week of work in Vancouver, BC, Canada manufacturing the last batch of MannaFlax with the supplies at our Surrey warehouse, and then packaging all the equipment and machinery for shipment back to Payson so we setup and continue operation in the states. This trip was very significant since it marked the end of the development cycle on the new health supplement we were making as we entered the production and commercial phase and started to sell product. I went to work on Monday expecting to start an endless (and hopefully increasing) cycle of making and selling. Instead, God had other plans. The Payson plant manager came to me and said that due to my efficient work effort in helping create MannaFlax and also some unrelated company financial difficulties I had worked myself out of a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expected to feel hurt or sad or disappointed, instead I felt happy and excited. When I started this job 17 months ago, I did it because God was clearly in it. Though I loved the job, and the interesting work, and fun coworkers, I always realized that the remote location was a very big drawback. Many times during my stay in Payson I’ve wanted to move so I could be closer to family and friends, but especially family. As hard as it was at times, I could never bring myself to leave because I was too comfortable to move and because I believed the Lord still wanted me here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For personal reasons, my week in Vancouver was very hard, a situation multiplied by the international factor prohibiting any phone calls to my family. I did a lot of thinking that week about packing up and moving on, even though I knew in my heart that I wouldn’t unless God clearly showed me I was to leave. Then unexpectedly on that Monday morning, God showed me the next step in His will.  And the event that I always viewed as a terrible thing made me smile because I knew my God cared for me and was making it easy for me to follow Him into the next adventure. It’s a funny thing about God, he likes to do things “backwards” but perfectly: first = last, humble = exalted, poor = rich, downsized = excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I finished up my work with the company and “put my affairs in order.” Then I flew out east for an absolute humdinger of a whirlwind tour with my family for Thanksgiving. Saying it was a great time would be an understatement. I am now back in Payson for a last few days packing up my few things in preparation to move home. My sister Sarah is flying out here tomorrow morning and we’ll be driving my Grandma Car back home. That should be a lot of fun. The church youth group is having a “We’re Mad at You for Leaving” party Wednesday night. Of all the things I’ll miss here in Arizona, by far the biggest will be the wonderful church family I have had the privilege of worshiping with this last year and some months. Ponderosa Baptist is a church where the majority of the people are doing ministry with the church is some way: it is a church that blows the 80-20 rule out of the water. It’s a beautiful thing to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now some people may think that this excursion to Payson has been a dead end that wasted many valuable months. In fact I am surprised that I don’t feel a little like that, but I find that I cannot be regretful in light of the many important things I’ve learned here. This post is already too long to list them all, and I’m sure I would forget some. I’m not sure if Payson, as a geographical location was so important, but the isolation from family and former friends, the unique mix of coworkers and new friends, and the special opportunities and challenges combined to make this “Payson Experience” a significant and necessary step in my personal growth. And let’s face it: Payson is a pretty nice place to live with one of the best climates I’ve ever experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I move ahead. I must confess I really don’t know what I’ll be doing next, other than spending a nice December with my family. January is an open slate and rather than worry about it, I’ll trust God that He will fill in the details in His way in His time. He’s done it before and He can do it again. Frankly, I’m pretty excited to see what God does! This is my Thanksgiving, and God is the hero.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lost in the Superstition Mountains, Part 2</title>
      <link>http://ryanclarke.github.io/journal/lost-in-the-superstition-mountains-part-2</link>

      <guid>http://ryanclarke.github.io/journal/lost-in-the-superstition-mountains-part-2</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I promised &lt;a href=&#34;/journal/lost-in-the-superstition-mountains&#34;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;, here are pictures from my adventure in the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went with some guys from church four-wheeling. We ended up getting lost and having to spend an extra day in the wild. I don&amp;rsquo;t have very many pictures yet, but here are a few. Here I am standing at the top of a hill we drove the trucks down. It was more like a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/journal/like-abraham.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Like Abraham&#34; title=&#34;Like Abraham&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a sample of the roads we drove on. One truck got so stuck that we had to leave it. We took everything valuable, like a carburetor, out of it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/journal/mountain-road.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mountain road&#34; title=&#34;Mountain Road&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll have better shots of the epic soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went out with some friends from church on Sunday and Monday. We went off-roading into the mountains east of Phoenix and camped the night. It was a rugged adventure. Unfortunately, the story doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense without images and my camera was one of the first things the wilderness claimed. Two other guys had cameras and took pictures and videos of most of the whole thing. So when I get a hold of some evidence, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell my once-in-a-lifetime (I hope!) tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, travel in pairs - or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&#34;/journal/lost-in-the-superstition-mountains-part-2&#34;&gt;pictures here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We made it. I am back. I will say one thing about Arizona&amp;rsquo;s countryside: it&amp;rsquo;s very unforgiving.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The wedding was very lovely, although not in the usual sense. It was clean. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t all the crazy fluff and froo-froo that normally accompanies weddings. Just 15 hymns, 2 sermons, and some heartfelt vows. Then we went to the reception. The grove (which I mentioned before) we all decked out with glowing orbs hanging from the trees and tiki lanterns around the pond and reflecting off the water. Beneath were table and chairs for eating the delicious treats they had laid out. Heather was there, and so I show you the only picture I had taken during the entire party. Amy, Josh, me, and Heather.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/d9378141588072/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://xd9.xanga.com/378d9b2b75d30141588072/b104456194.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Strickler Wedding&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
Also, Luke Johnson was there but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a picture. And so we eventually saw the new couple off for their adventure in Boston. And we returned to the house to throw the leftover candies in the air and try to catch them in our mouths. I cannot hold a candle to the Strickler family in that skill area.
On Sunday morning we went to church. The worship service style was very old fashioned as was the music also. It was really neat to get to participate. The have an extensive sharing and testimonial time during the first hours of the service and I exercised great self-control and did not stand up and blab. Then they asked if any visitors would like to share, so I acquiesced. I read Ephesians 4:3-6. Afterwards during the succulent potluck many folks thanked me for sharing. I guess giving testimonials is highly regarded and encouraged, so they were very happy that a guest joined in. I was just moved to partake of the rich spiritual unity among such different traditional customs. They had a lot of dessert.
Flying out I sat next to an Israeli guy who makes processors for Nikon cameras. He&amp;rsquo;s doing four months of job training her in Phoenix. He was reading a Russian book (that, interestingly, had a Japanese guy on the front).
In Phoenix I was able to get right into my car, which was a great relief, because going out there I had left my keys in the ignition. But I had the shuttle bus guy drive me back to the lot and the car was unlocked and I got my keys and all. So I had no trouble coming home. What a dumb stunt that was though.
The Strickler family is one of the most hospitable families I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met. The entire trip was a blast. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I went and it was good to see Josh get all happily married off.

      <title>The Lake Powell Adventure</title>
      <link>http://ryanclarke.github.io/journal/the-lake-powell-adventure</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2007 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Lake Powell Adventure - Extended Edition
Lake Powell on the Colorado River is the second largest man-made lake in the world (after Lake Mead downstream) but it has by far the largest water volume because it&amp;rsquo;s basically Glen Canyon filled with water. In fact, the sides of the lake are so steep in most places that there are only 6 marinas in the entire 1,900 miles of shoreline. When it was finished back in 1966 it took 17 years to fill up. Right now it&amp;rsquo;s only about 60% full.
We stayed at the Wahweap, AZ marina area right near the Glen Canyon Dam.
 &lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/7a5fd140241489/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://x7a.xanga.com/5fdd9645c6030140241489/b103325772.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Glen Canyon Dam&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
You can see our campsite in this picture along with our church bus and the lake in the background.
 &lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/51980140241597/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://x51.xanga.com/980d905760330140241597/b103325871.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Lake Powell Campsite&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
The lake looked beautiful from the top of the hill during sunrise.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/fb429140241768/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://xfb.xanga.com/429d664450431140241768/b103326015.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Sunrise on Lake Powell&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
In this picture you can see the &amp;ldquo;cove&amp;rdquo; where we spent the day swimming. We used Pastor Allen&amp;rsquo;s Dad&amp;rsquo;s boat to get over there. I say cove because this protrusion of water usually connects with the water under the cliffs in the background making our sandy beach normally under many feet of water as you can tell from the obvious &amp;ldquo;bathtub&amp;rdquo; ring.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/4edbb140241673/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://x4e.xanga.com/dbb8266445168140241673/b103325932.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Lake Powell Cove&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
On Friday I drove up to the Navajo Nation to meet up with the youth group where they had been doing a VBS at a local church all week. As I was driving along Saint Mary&amp;rsquo;s Lake Road keeping myself entertained with songs and jokes I started sing &amp;ldquo;Over the Rainbow.&amp;rdquo; I just reached the part when it goes, &amp;ldquo;Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; when a bird of some type headbutted my front grill. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s one way to go over the rainbow.
After meeting the youth in Gray Mountain we traveled by church bus up to Wahweap where we pulled out the tents and realized that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have space for everyone. A lot of the guys opted to sleep under the stars because it seemed exciting. I ended up getting a spot in a tent, which was good because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a sleeping bag. I&amp;rsquo;m not very practiced of late with the me-and-the-dirt style of sleeping, so the night didn&amp;rsquo;t go so well. The dirt won.
The lady who normally comes on these trip and cooks wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to to make it, and her daughter who ended up planning the meals got sick and went home before the Lake Powell portion, so the meals fell to Ben and I. So we woke up on Saturday morning and went to cook the pancakes (from mix, fortunately!) with: no mixing bowl, no measuring cups, no spatula. It was interesting. We borrowed a metal fork so we had something non-melting to flip with, we measured the water with a pint bottle and the mix with a 10oz cup and stirred in a coffeepot. The bacon had to be placed in a coffee cup since the sizzling strips were melting the styrofoam plates. We also didn&amp;rsquo;t think and cooked the bacon first, so the first few pancakes were saturated in bacon grease, which was pretty gross, but Jess liked them, so whatever floats his boat. But everyone enjoyed the meal (I hope) and we headed off to the lake.
I remembered to put on sunscreen and hardly got burned at all except a little on my forehead. But Steven didn&amp;rsquo;t put on a drop and ended the day past red, past brown, to deep gray, like charcoal. The rocks around our cove were sandstone, which is really gritty so it makes it easy to climb up the fairly steep &amp;lsquo;cliffs&amp;rsquo; which dropped deep into the water. However, if you clung to one spot too long the sandstone turned to a slimy sand and send you sliding back into the water. So we had a good day and were totally tired by evening when we went by the local resort and relaxed by dashing madly between the hot tub and cold pool. We didn&amp;rsquo;t bother anyone with our antics because they all left when it started to storm out in the distance. But there&amp;rsquo;s nothing like repeatedly shocking the core of your system under a gathering canopy with some mood lightning.
Then we went to sleep and most of the guys slept in the but because the sand wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking goodunder the monsoon. I ended up being &amp;ldquo;houseleader&amp;rdquo; of the bus, while Pastor Allen took the tented guys and his sister Nita took the girls. The armrests in the bus don&amp;rsquo;t fold up so I had to fit my entire torso onto two seats. My head and torso are 3 inches too long. and I had one leg under the armrests and one leg over, and it was numb in two places all night.
Then we all woke up for more pancakes and bacon. It went a lot better because Mr. Benkert had gone over the dam to Page, AZ because it&amp;rsquo;s a big enough city to have a Wal*Mart and he bought measuring cups, spatulas, and ladels. Also, we had some girls make the food. They claimed it was all them, but of course, Ben and I know better that it was really just the superior equipment they had. But they were smart enough to do the pancakes first, so I will give them (and their moms) some credit for knowing these elusive secrets to successful meals.
And we drove back on Sunday. I sat on the front seat of the bus so I could talk to Pastor Allen and enjoy the panorama the large windows afforded. The downside was that I was right under the air conditioning unit which was dripping on me every 10-12 seconds, like a multi-decade Chinese water torture regimen. I took some pictures but I won&amp;rsquo;t post them here because they are so disappointing (not like the first ones were spectacular either, but I had to show something). The Great American West is so huge and rugged that you have to see it to understand.
And we got home and I took a shower and then slept for 10 and a half hours so I&amp;rsquo;d be ready for work. It was a very fun trip and I hope that some of the little conversations I had with the various kids will help support what Pastor Allen is teaching them and will help them follow Christ all the more as they go through these formative years.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back from the crazy adventuring at Lake Powell.
We were out in the Great Western Desert Wilderness And Sprawling Man-Made Lakes section of our country where there are hardly any modern conveniences like cellphone reception or warm showers. After hours of drive, hours of swimming, hours of sleeping on the ground, and hours of hanging out and chaperoning kids with an often low maturity to energy ratio, I&amp;rsquo;m fairly tired. I&amp;rsquo;ll post the few pictures I have later. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take many because of all the water, both lake and rain. But for now, since I&amp;rsquo;ve had my shower: sleep (the in-a-bed kind!). Actually, for all the hardships and complaining that camping often spawns, it&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of fun.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m off!
I&amp;rsquo;m just putting in a half-day of work today and now I&amp;rsquo;m headed out to do some crazy adventuring at Lake Powell. My church&amp;rsquo;s youth group was up north at the Navajo Nation all week doing a VBS and now all the retired adult chaperones are tired and don&amp;rsquo;t feel up to the trekking and water sports and paintball, so I&amp;rsquo;m going up to help out and fill in. That&amp;rsquo;s code for: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going on vacation!&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll be back on Sunday night.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So my family left this morning. Except Ben who&amp;rsquo;s staying through Thursday.
We watched a rodeo parade, saw a cowboy action shoot, went to the aero fair, the rodeo, and church, watched Bringing Up Baby, and generally had a great time this weekend. I love my family.
No pictures, sorry. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xanga.com/sarahdipityinlime&#34;&gt;Sarah&amp;rsquo;s xanga&lt;/a&gt; to see some of the family&amp;rsquo;s trip photos.
