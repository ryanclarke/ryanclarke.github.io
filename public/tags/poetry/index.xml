      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the other side of childhood&lt;br /&gt;
When youth’s young bud has grown&lt;br /&gt;
And some flowers it has bloomed produce&lt;br /&gt;
A sprout to call their own,&lt;br /&gt;
May the length of ages not induce&lt;br /&gt;
What often it has wrought&lt;br /&gt;
In accum&amp;rsquo;lative forgetfulness&lt;br /&gt;
And stiffening of thought:&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t ignore the lofty joy and stress&lt;br /&gt;
A juvenile knows,&lt;br /&gt;
But with lavish love fulfill the needs—&lt;br /&gt;
Like rain upon the flower seeds—&lt;br /&gt;
Required by each that grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of childhood&lt;br /&gt;
Recall where once you stood.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fable of Simon McDarpet</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I give you the fable of Simon McDarpet,&lt;br /&gt;
A boy, it would seem, with a hatred for carpet;&lt;br /&gt;
And tables, of course, and most anything wooden&lt;br /&gt;
And things that get hurt when you act like you shouldn’t,&lt;br /&gt;
And all sorts of rugs, also windows and doors.&lt;br /&gt;
But your guess would be right if you singled out floors.&lt;br /&gt;
You’d be right on the money—the wad that was spent—&lt;br /&gt;
On repairing the issues he could have prevent-&lt;br /&gt;
ed because of the sloshing of liquids he did,&lt;br /&gt;
All because he refused to seal drinks with a lid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t get me started on all of the chow&lt;br /&gt;
That was strewn down the hall in the wake of that cow.&lt;br /&gt;
Steaming heaps of lasagna and well-buttered biscuits,&lt;br /&gt;
Potatoes with herbs that were creamed with a wisk—it’s&lt;br /&gt;
A shame—and I know of the groans in my belly,&lt;br /&gt;
Surveying the wasted baked oatmeal and jelly.&lt;br /&gt;
However the groans that were felt in the gut&lt;br /&gt;
Of another man spying the path to the mutt&lt;br /&gt;
(Like a humanoid snail or a monstrous slug&lt;br /&gt;
Who was leaving a trail of wet smears on the rug);&lt;br /&gt;
These were groans that could make a man wither in fear&lt;br /&gt;
And concurrently make that same man shed a tear,&lt;br /&gt;
As poor Curtis would go fetch the tools of his trade,&lt;br /&gt;
For the treasure of kingdoms could scarcely have paid&lt;br /&gt;
For the hours he spent grimly cleaning the carpet&lt;br /&gt;
Of stains that were left by that Simon McDarpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ll remember, dear cleanliness lover,&lt;br /&gt;
To never move food without using a cover.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When the Frost is on the Punkin</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m loving the fall here in Indiana. I can finally understand the scenes so richly described in my favorite poem by Indianapolis&amp;rsquo; own &amp;ldquo;Hoosier Poet.&amp;rdquo; I print below the entire text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;When the Frost is on the Punkin&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Whitcomb Riley&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHEN the frost is on the punkin and the fodder&amp;rsquo;s in the shock,&lt;br /&gt;
And you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin&amp;rsquo; turkey-cock,&lt;br /&gt;
And the clackin&amp;rsquo; of the guineys, and the cluckin&amp;rsquo; of the hens,&lt;br /&gt;
And the rooster&amp;rsquo;s hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the fence;&lt;br /&gt;
O, it&amp;rsquo;s then the time a feller is a-feelin&amp;rsquo; at his best,&lt;br /&gt;
With the risin&amp;rsquo; sun to greet him from a night of peaceful rest,&lt;br /&gt;
As he leaves the house, bareheaded, and goes out to feed the stock,&lt;br /&gt;
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder&amp;rsquo;s in the shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;s something kindo&amp;rsquo; harty-like about the atmusfere&lt;br /&gt;
When the heat of summer&amp;rsquo;s over and the coolin&amp;rsquo; fall is here—&lt;br /&gt;
Of course we miss the flowers, and the blossoms on the trees,&lt;br /&gt;
And the mumble of the hummin&amp;rsquo;-birds and buzzin&amp;rsquo; of the bees;&lt;br /&gt;
But the air&amp;rsquo;s so appetizin&amp;rsquo;; and the landscape through the haze&lt;br /&gt;
Of a crisp and sunny morning of the airly autumn days&lt;br /&gt;
Is a pictur&amp;rsquo; that no painter has the colorin&amp;rsquo; to mock—&lt;br /&gt;
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder&amp;rsquo;s in the shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The husky, rusty russel of the tossels of the corn,&lt;br /&gt;
And the raspin&amp;rsquo; of the tangled leaves as golden as the morn;&lt;br /&gt;
The stubble in the furries—kindo&amp;rsquo; lonesome-like, but still&lt;br /&gt;
A-preachin&amp;rsquo; sermuns to us of the barns they growed to fill;&lt;br /&gt;
The strawstack in the medder, and the reaper in the shed;&lt;br /&gt;
The hosses in theyr stalls below—the clover overhead!—&lt;br /&gt;
O, it sets my hart a-clickin&amp;rsquo; like the tickin&amp;rsquo; of a clock,&lt;br /&gt;
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder&amp;rsquo;s in the shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then your apples all is gethered, and the ones a feller keeps&lt;br /&gt;
Is poured around the cellar-floor in red and yaller heaps;&lt;br /&gt;
And your cider-makin&amp;rsquo;s over, and your wimmern-folks is through&lt;br /&gt;
With theyr mince and apple-butter, and theyr souse and sausage too!&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to tell it—but ef such a thing could be&lt;br /&gt;
As the angels wantin&amp;rsquo; boardin&amp;rsquo;, and they&amp;rsquo;d call around on me—&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d want to &amp;lsquo;commodate &amp;lsquo;em—all the whole-indurin&amp;rsquo; flock—&lt;br /&gt;
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder&amp;rsquo;s in the shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
