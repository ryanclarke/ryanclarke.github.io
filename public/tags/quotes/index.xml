      <description>&lt;p&gt;Andrew and I went to the dump to dispose of our trash. This is what he said on our road home.
Andrew: &amp;ldquo;Deers are used to the sound of cars but they don&amp;rsquo;t like cars. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that funny? Did you know that if you&amp;rsquo;re covered in spices you won&amp;rsquo;t rot? I was just thinking about that because we drove past the cemetery back there: the one with the dead people. In the old days - I don&amp;rsquo;t think they do it anymore - in the old days they used to bury people in the Pharaoh places. You know, those things. They had hallways and were big. And I was thinking: wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be funny today if they buried people in one?&amp;rdquo;
Ryan: I think it would be expensive.
Andrew: I guess so.
Ryan
