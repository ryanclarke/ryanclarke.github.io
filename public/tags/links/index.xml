      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.online-stopwatch.com/large-stopwatch/%20&#34;&gt;http://www.online-stopwatch.com/large-stopwatch/&lt;/a&gt;, I read the Hardy Boys book The Tower Treasure in 1 hour and 11 minutes and 1 second. That is shorter than the movie would be. This beats my previous (and first) record of 1 hour and 45 minutes, roughly.

And that, my friends, is a snapshot of my read this past year, at least the part I can remember tonight. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll add more when I think of them, but don&amp;rsquo;t hold your breath (asphyxiation is bad for your health).

By the way, I have a new Verizon cell number. Don&amp;rsquo;t call my old phone anymore.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I cooked myself a nice, juicy, ribeye steak last night after marinating it for 3 days. And I had mashed potatoes. I just figured I&amp;rsquo;d let you all know.
I met the girl who&amp;rsquo;s dad painted the Herbie in my town. Her name was Emerald.
It looks like Intel is going to phase out their single-core processors at the beginning of next year. Only dual- and quad-core will be available. And I doubt AMD will hold onto single-core much longer. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the consumer-priced quad-core 45nm PSUs that Intel has coming next February, although I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;ll get one. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely an interesting time on the PC hardware front as we&amp;rsquo;re finally starting to see the effects of Vista on hardware design. (That statement is not completely true, but that&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable consumer perspective on the trend.) Also, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntu.com/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu 7.10&lt;/a&gt; just came out yesterday. I&amp;rsquo;m downloading it today.
1111 days on xanga for me.
