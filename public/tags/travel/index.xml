      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made it back to Georgia about 24 hours ago. Sarah and I left Arizona a week ago Thursday and 2001 miles, 7 days, and 11 states later we made it home. Of course, you may be thinking that a week is a long time for such a drive and you&amp;rsquo;re right. We stopped for a day in Kansas for Mama Shoe&amp;rsquo;s memorial service and two days in Kentucky visiting the Reckner&amp;rsquo;s. So it was a leisurely trip. The last day was the most eventful. We were hardly 5 miles from the Reckner&amp;rsquo;s when the rear passenger tire totally disintegrated. We had to unload the entire trunk to get the jack and the spare out and that when I discovered that the included jack was totally useless for changing the rear tire. Fortunately Mr. Reckner had a bottle jack and was able to help me get changed to limp into town and get a new tire. It took a while so we didn&amp;rsquo;t head for home until mid-afternoon. But we&amp;rsquo;re back and it&amp;rsquo;s great to be with family again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the next step, whatever it is. All this has kept me crushingly busy so I&amp;rsquo;ll probably take a short breather and then start pursuing my future again with anticipation. There are these little dreams we all have, and maybe some of mine will start to come true. By &amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo; dreams, I mean those impossibly magnificient ideas that we harbor so close to our soul until they become a living part of us. Life isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy, but it&amp;rsquo;s terribly exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The wedding was amazing. I have spent the last few days at home and now we&amp;rsquo;re all headed up to North Carolina for Thanksgiving. Here&amp;rsquo;s wishing you all a happy Thanksgiving and a grateful heart.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m headed east! I&amp;rsquo;m spending a day at Verity before heading down to my good friend Bryce&amp;rsquo;s wedding where I&amp;rsquo;ll be the best man. Then I spend the whole following week and Thanksgiving with my family. This is going to be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Pastor Allen gave me a gift certificate to the Phoenix Symphony in appreciation for me filling in for him these last two weeks. I was quite surprised on top of happy. Of all the perfect gifts! So, now I just have to decide what I want to see&amp;hellip; and who to bring with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just a few hours I head to the church to begin my long weekend with the youth. We drive through the night, spend Saturday at Magic Mountain riding coasters, Sunday morning at the beach freezing in the water, and then we drive and get back Sunday night. It&amp;rsquo;s 8 hours to Santa Barbara. And 8 hours back.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lost in the Superstition Mountains, Part 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I promised &lt;a href=&#34;/journal/lost-in-the-superstition-mountains&#34;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;, here are pictures from my adventure in the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went with some guys from church four-wheeling. We ended up getting lost and having to spend an extra day in the wild. I don&amp;rsquo;t have very many pictures yet, but here are a few. Here I am standing at the top of a hill we drove the trucks down. It was more like a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/journal/like-abraham.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Like Abraham&#34; title=&#34;Like Abraham&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a sample of the roads we drove on. One truck got so stuck that we had to leave it. We took everything valuable, like a carburetor, out of it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/journal/mountain-road.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mountain road&#34; title=&#34;Mountain Road&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll have better shots of the epic soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went out with some friends from church on Sunday and Monday. We went off-roading into the mountains east of Phoenix and camped the night. It was a rugged adventure. Unfortunately, the story doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense without images and my camera was one of the first things the wilderness claimed. Two other guys had cameras and took pictures and videos of most of the whole thing. So when I get a hold of some evidence, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell my once-in-a-lifetime (I hope!) tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, travel in pairs - or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&#34;/journal/lost-in-the-superstition-mountains-part-2&#34;&gt;pictures here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The wedding was very lovely, although not in the usual sense. It was clean. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t all the crazy fluff and froo-froo that normally accompanies weddings. Just 15 hymns, 2 sermons, and some heartfelt vows. Then we went to the reception. The grove (which I mentioned before) we all decked out with glowing orbs hanging from the trees and tiki lanterns around the pond and reflecting off the water. Beneath were table and chairs for eating the delicious treats they had laid out. Heather was there, and so I show you the only picture I had taken during the entire party. Amy, Josh, me, and Heather.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/d9378141588072/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://xd9.xanga.com/378d9b2b75d30141588072/b104456194.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Strickler Wedding&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
Also, Luke Johnson was there but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a picture. And so we eventually saw the new couple off for their adventure in Boston. And we returned to the house to throw the leftover candies in the air and try to catch them in our mouths. I cannot hold a candle to the Strickler family in that skill area.
On Sunday morning we went to church. The worship service style was very old fashioned as was the music also. It was really neat to get to participate. The have an extensive sharing and testimonial time during the first hours of the service and I exercised great self-control and did not stand up and blab. Then they asked if any visitors would like to share, so I acquiesced. I read Ephesians 4:3-6. Afterwards during the succulent potluck many folks thanked me for sharing. I guess giving testimonials is highly regarded and encouraged, so they were very happy that a guest joined in. I was just moved to partake of the rich spiritual unity among such different traditional customs. They had a lot of dessert.
Flying out I sat next to an Israeli guy who makes processors for Nikon cameras. He&amp;rsquo;s doing four months of job training her in Phoenix. He was reading a Russian book (that, interestingly, had a Japanese guy on the front).
In Phoenix I was able to get right into my car, which was a great relief, because going out there I had left my keys in the ignition. But I had the shuttle bus guy drive me back to the lot and the car was unlocked and I got my keys and all. So I had no trouble coming home. What a dumb stunt that was though.
The Strickler family is one of the most hospitable families I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met. The entire trip was a blast. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I went and it was good to see Josh get all happily married off.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The wedding was great. In fact, the entire weekend was a blast. I&amp;rsquo;ll post more later.

P.S. This post was mostly for Mom&amp;rsquo;s benefit so she can know that I got home safely.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a little slower around here now. Everyone of importance is out taking pictures. Or rather, having pictures of themselves taken.
I am thoroughly enjoying having a blast here. I&amp;rsquo;m staying with the Stricklers and it is definitely the place to be. The whole family is fun and energetic. Yesterday and this morning we spent a lot of time getting the Strickler&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;backyard&amp;rdquo; ready for the reception. It&amp;rsquo;s in the &amp;lsquo;grove&amp;rsquo; next to the pond. I put grove within marks because it&amp;rsquo;s unlike a normal grove. Their grandfather loved trees so he planted over 300 different types of trees around the farm (some of which has since been sold off to make a highway). The grove has about 30 huge trees of several varieties including a redwood and the back side of the pond has about 40 more types. The evergreen windbreak in front of the house is equally varied. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a really neat look. So the reception is ready. Also, Josh and I got his new radio wired into his car. So it looks like everything is in order for the wedding this evening at the church and then the reception afterward.
I wish more of you Verity friends of Josh could have come, you&amp;rsquo;d be having a blast too.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have this one day of work and then I leave for Harrisburg, PA. I&amp;rsquo;m flying through the night out to Josh Strickler&amp;rsquo;s wedding. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited about the whole trip. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll pack tonight after work.

      <title>The Lake Powell Adventure</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/journal/the-lake-powell-adventure</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2007 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Lake Powell Adventure - Extended Edition
Lake Powell on the Colorado River is the second largest man-made lake in the world (after Lake Mead downstream) but it has by far the largest water volume because it&amp;rsquo;s basically Glen Canyon filled with water. In fact, the sides of the lake are so steep in most places that there are only 6 marinas in the entire 1,900 miles of shoreline. When it was finished back in 1966 it took 17 years to fill up. Right now it&amp;rsquo;s only about 60% full.
We stayed at the Wahweap, AZ marina area right near the Glen Canyon Dam.
 &lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/7a5fd140241489/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://x7a.xanga.com/5fdd9645c6030140241489/b103325772.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Glen Canyon Dam&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
You can see our campsite in this picture along with our church bus and the lake in the background.
 &lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/51980140241597/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://x51.xanga.com/980d905760330140241597/b103325871.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Lake Powell Campsite&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
The lake looked beautiful from the top of the hill during sunrise.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/fb429140241768/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://xfb.xanga.com/429d664450431140241768/b103326015.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Sunrise on Lake Powell&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
In this picture you can see the &amp;ldquo;cove&amp;rdquo; where we spent the day swimming. We used Pastor Allen&amp;rsquo;s Dad&amp;rsquo;s boat to get over there. I say cove because this protrusion of water usually connects with the water under the cliffs in the background making our sandy beach normally under many feet of water as you can tell from the obvious &amp;ldquo;bathtub&amp;rdquo; ring.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://photo.xanga.com/classicalRyan/4edbb140241673/photo.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://x4e.xanga.com/dbb8266445168140241673/b103325932.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Lake Powell Cove&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
On Friday I drove up to the Navajo Nation to meet up with the youth group where they had been doing a VBS at a local church all week. As I was driving along Saint Mary&amp;rsquo;s Lake Road keeping myself entertained with songs and jokes I started sing &amp;ldquo;Over the Rainbow.&amp;rdquo; I just reached the part when it goes, &amp;ldquo;Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; when a bird of some type headbutted my front grill. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s one way to go over the rainbow.
After meeting the youth in Gray Mountain we traveled by church bus up to Wahweap where we pulled out the tents and realized that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have space for everyone. A lot of the guys opted to sleep under the stars because it seemed exciting. I ended up getting a spot in a tent, which was good because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a sleeping bag. I&amp;rsquo;m not very practiced of late with the me-and-the-dirt style of sleeping, so the night didn&amp;rsquo;t go so well. The dirt won.
The lady who normally comes on these trip and cooks wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to to make it, and her daughter who ended up planning the meals got sick and went home before the Lake Powell portion, so the meals fell to Ben and I. So we woke up on Saturday morning and went to cook the pancakes (from mix, fortunately!) with: no mixing bowl, no measuring cups, no spatula. It was interesting. We borrowed a metal fork so we had something non-melting to flip with, we measured the water with a pint bottle and the mix with a 10oz cup and stirred in a coffeepot. The bacon had to be placed in a coffee cup since the sizzling strips were melting the styrofoam plates. We also didn&amp;rsquo;t think and cooked the bacon first, so the first few pancakes were saturated in bacon grease, which was pretty gross, but Jess liked them, so whatever floats his boat. But everyone enjoyed the meal (I hope) and we headed off to the lake.
I remembered to put on sunscreen and hardly got burned at all except a little on my forehead. But Steven didn&amp;rsquo;t put on a drop and ended the day past red, past brown, to deep gray, like charcoal. The rocks around our cove were sandstone, which is really gritty so it makes it easy to climb up the fairly steep &amp;lsquo;cliffs&amp;rsquo; which dropped deep into the water. However, if you clung to one spot too long the sandstone turned to a slimy sand and send you sliding back into the water. So we had a good day and were totally tired by evening when we went by the local resort and relaxed by dashing madly between the hot tub and cold pool. We didn&amp;rsquo;t bother anyone with our antics because they all left when it started to storm out in the distance. But there&amp;rsquo;s nothing like repeatedly shocking the core of your system under a gathering canopy with some mood lightning.
Then we went to sleep and most of the guys slept in the but because the sand wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking goodunder the monsoon. I ended up being &amp;ldquo;houseleader&amp;rdquo; of the bus, while Pastor Allen took the tented guys and his sister Nita took the girls. The armrests in the bus don&amp;rsquo;t fold up so I had to fit my entire torso onto two seats. My head and torso are 3 inches too long. and I had one leg under the armrests and one leg over, and it was numb in two places all night.
Then we all woke up for more pancakes and bacon. It went a lot better because Mr. Benkert had gone over the dam to Page, AZ because it&amp;rsquo;s a big enough city to have a Wal*Mart and he bought measuring cups, spatulas, and ladels. Also, we had some girls make the food. They claimed it was all them, but of course, Ben and I know better that it was really just the superior equipment they had. But they were smart enough to do the pancakes first, so I will give them (and their moms) some credit for knowing these elusive secrets to successful meals.
And we drove back on Sunday. I sat on the front seat of the bus so I could talk to Pastor Allen and enjoy the panorama the large windows afforded. The downside was that I was right under the air conditioning unit which was dripping on me every 10-12 seconds, like a multi-decade Chinese water torture regimen. I took some pictures but I won&amp;rsquo;t post them here because they are so disappointing (not like the first ones were spectacular either, but I had to show something). The Great American West is so huge and rugged that you have to see it to understand.
And we got home and I took a shower and then slept for 10 and a half hours so I&amp;rsquo;d be ready for work. It was a very fun trip and I hope that some of the little conversations I had with the various kids will help support what Pastor Allen is teaching them and will help them follow Christ all the more as they go through these formative years.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back from the crazy adventuring at Lake Powell.
We were out in the Great Western Desert Wilderness And Sprawling Man-Made Lakes section of our country where there are hardly any modern conveniences like cellphone reception or warm showers. After hours of drive, hours of swimming, hours of sleeping on the ground, and hours of hanging out and chaperoning kids with an often low maturity to energy ratio, I&amp;rsquo;m fairly tired. I&amp;rsquo;ll post the few pictures I have later. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take many because of all the water, both lake and rain. But for now, since I&amp;rsquo;ve had my shower: sleep (the in-a-bed kind!). Actually, for all the hardships and complaining that camping often spawns, it&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of fun.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m off!
I&amp;rsquo;m just putting in a half-day of work today and now I&amp;rsquo;m headed out to do some crazy adventuring at Lake Powell. My church&amp;rsquo;s youth group was up north at the Navajo Nation all week doing a VBS and now all the retired adult chaperones are tired and don&amp;rsquo;t feel up to the trekking and water sports and paintball, so I&amp;rsquo;m going up to help out and fill in. That&amp;rsquo;s code for: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going on vacation!&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll be back on Sunday night.
