My elbow feels like a camel's elbow. I'm sure you all have seen pictures of the massive sores camels get on their knees. Well, I guess I don't have a massive sore. My left elbow hurts. I've been leaning on it way too much for the last weeks as I hunch over my theory assignments. Which reminds me: my back is sore. But mostly my left elbow.
 I'm glad it's finally the weekend! Clear the mind, take it easy on the elbow, etc.
 Have a great one yourself!
 Oh, and don't just comment to say sorry or something, unless you have some ointments or salves or poultices you'd recommend that I try.
 Ryan
