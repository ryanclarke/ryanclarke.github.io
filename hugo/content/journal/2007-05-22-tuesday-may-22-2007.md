So my family left this morning. Except Ben who's staying through Thursday.
We watched a rodeo parade, saw a cowboy action shoot, went to the aero fair, the rodeo, and church, watched Bringing Up Baby, and generally had a great time this weekend. I love my family.
No pictures, sorry. Check out [Sarah's xanga](http://www.xanga.com/sarahdipityinlime) to see some of the family's trip photos.
