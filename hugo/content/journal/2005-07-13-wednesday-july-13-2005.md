I'm back from the family reunion. Actually, I've been back for a few days: we arrived home on Saturday. We brought our 11 year-old cousin Kyle back with us to spend the week and he leaves tomorrow. The reunion was fun, at least, the stuff we did. We went to the beach one day, on the most un-beachy day of the whole trip. So we buried one of our cousins completely under the sand, face up (with a shirt covering his face) and then sprinkled potato chips on him. The seagull would fly over and land on him and when he felt them pecking his stumach (he had a few welts afterwards) he spring and try to grab them. We didn't manage to catch any, but we did keep the lifegaurds entertained. And we went a toured the grounds of this huge mansion: The Breakers. It was really neat. And I didn't get to go sailing, but that's OK.
 Only a few more days, I go back to Flint on Monday the 18th.
