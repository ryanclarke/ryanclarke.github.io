Is anyone flying into Charlotte on Friday afternoon for Garret and Julia's wedding? I'm pretty much going, but I need to figure out some logistical things before I buy the tickets, etc.
I got a lot done at work today. I mean, I felt like I made more progress in 4 hours this morning than I have in the previous week and a half. It was neat.
