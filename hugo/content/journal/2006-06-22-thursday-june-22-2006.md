I did office work today: sitting like a bum in a nice cushy chair in the air conditioning. A far cry from soaking in waste water... I'm clean and dry at the end of the day!
I looked at two rentals already today. I'm about to go try to see in a third that looks like it could be very good - I'm hoping it works out!
Chow!
