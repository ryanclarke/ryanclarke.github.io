So the girls are gone on their camping trip where it looks like they will have thunderstorms tomorrow night and Sunday and the tempature will barely make it to 70 degree. Cold and rainy: poor girls, at least they have yurts this year.
 So the guys are going to go to the Shoemakers tonight for an all-night, all-guy party. It should be a lot of fun.
 Virginia and Crystal took their Harmony 2 final tests today. I pray that they pass.
