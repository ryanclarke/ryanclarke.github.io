I went for a nice bike ride through the streets of Monterrey this afternoon with the 3 brothers. It was a nice ride. Then this evening Judah and I went over to these people's house to try to get Skype working with their computers. We took a few hours to not get anywhere, but at least they have better firewall and anti-virus software now. It's kind of crazy working on a machine using a foreign language. Judah helped a lot though. And they even bought us tacos de trompo for dinner. Good food. JRod had his radio shot tonight, but unfortunately I missed it.
