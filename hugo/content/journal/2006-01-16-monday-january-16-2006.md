I got to play Axis & Allies today. I love that board game. The Boones invited me over to play with them, they never had before. They did very well for being their first time. We played for about 6 hours. Didn't quite finish, but I think the Allies were set up well to win. I was the USA, and we were beating down hard on Germany: they were about to fall. Japan was doing pretty well, but it was a house of cards: about to collapse, soon after Germany did. Very fun afternoon.
 MJK Jr. day is over, so Ben is heading back to GSU. It was good having him home for the weekend.
