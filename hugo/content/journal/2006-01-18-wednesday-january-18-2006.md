Today is the one year anniversary of the Verity '05 class's arrival in China. We touched down in Shanghai in the late afternoon, went through the official stuff, and then took an hour and 45 minute bus ride to Pinghu where we fell asleep in our new rooms totally exhausted after a 28 hour trip. It was my first time on foreign soil, and it was really foreign. And thus began a very fun, growing, challenging, and inspirational month. It's amazing how that month in China helped launch so many of the amazing things that have happened to me in this last year.
 Also, I just found out that the reception following the Saturday performance is \$20 per ticket. For that price, it's probably pretty nice. But I figured you all would like to know that in advance. Especially, being \$20.
 In imitation of [Jess's post](http://www.xanga.com/KaylaSkylar/427695204/item.html) with the despair.com picture. This picture of me was taken and edited by David Prentice at The Wilds Music Conference a few weeks ago.
