And so we return to the normally scheduled broadcast. Judging from comments, most of you don't find first hand accounts of Nazi Germany interesting. I find first hand accounts of just about any history interesting.
A good way to end a book:
"Aravis also had many quarrels (and, I'm afraid, even fights) with Cor, but they always made it up again: so that years later, when they were grown up, they were so used to quarreling and making up again that they got married so as to go on doing it more conveniently." - C.S. Lewis, The Horse and His Boy
