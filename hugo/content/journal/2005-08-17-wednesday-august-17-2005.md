I sit here and think. Thinking is an amazing ability. Have you ever thought about thinking? But not just thinking: thinking for myself. The more I think about it, the more I think that very few people think for themself anymore. We have all this talk about "thinking outside the box." But what forms the box? Thoughts. It's a mental/logical framework to hang other thoughts on. So the questiong is not "are you thinking outside the box?' It's "how big is your box?" So many people use other people's boxes, or a predifined institutionalized box. I choose to use my own box. I want to create my own box from the pages of scripture. This is what is meant by "renewing your mind." (Romans 12:2) May I not let the world feed me it's thought patterns.
