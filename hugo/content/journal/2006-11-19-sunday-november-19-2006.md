I've been on xanga for 777 days (wow, that's a big number).
Sir Malcolm Arnold was a genius. Take for example his Four Cornish Dances, Op. 91.
I saw a large, elderly lady with big hair dressed all in spotless white attire speeding on a shiney moped today.
"Look at my room: it's so clean."
"Wow Faas."
"I know, it's incredible. I should light a candle."
"Good idea."
So we lit a commemorative candle. Bayberry scent, meaning it smells like pine trees, hence, "bayberry:" get it?
"We have 7 irons to kill people with. Wait, this one's a 9 iron." Faas then reenacted San Juan Hill with the golf club. If there had been any Cubans in our living room they certainly would have fled.
