Tonight I am going to ask a question to all you readers. First some background.
Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He was the central figure in history. The Old Testament begins with His creation of the universe and then continues to prepare His coming, the Gospels recount His life and death on earth, and the rest of the New Testament expounds on the impact He left, finishing with an incredible description of His coming return. Humans throughout history have waited for His coming and now His return. His life has impacted more people in more ways than any other person, and His death has accomplished something no other person ever has or ever will be able to reproduce: the offer of forgiven sins. This incredible 'resume' demands an answer to one crucial question.
Why did Jesus come to earth?
