I didn't do quite as well yesterday with the baseball as on Thursday. For the first half, at least. The second half of the day I ended up getting a few good hits and catches, so that was nice.
 So Ben Andrews is gone. But it looks like our families might hook up this Winter Break, so that would be neat. Maybe at Warm Springs or Callaway Gardens down near Pine Mountain and FDR State Park.
 Thank you to Allison's family for the wonderful food they made last night! Thanks for inviting me!
