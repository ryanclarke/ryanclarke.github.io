"Duck" is considered by many to be the funniest (clean) work in the English language. In fact, the duck must just be a funny animal because, no matter it's pronunciation, the word for "duck" is considered inherently funny in almost every language. What an interesting idea - the inherently funny word. See what you think about this joke:

Duck
Haha, that one get's me every time.
On a personal note, I worked from home today. 'Office' work. I'm working on starting to investigate into what would be required to get us (Pulse Combustion Systems) cGMP certified (current Good Manufacturing Practices). The regulations are good stuff when you're at the store buying pills because you know the medicine is quality controlled, but reading the FDA codes on cGMP is fairly long. The codes are so thorough, that they just take a while to work through. We'll see what I can come up with over these next days.
