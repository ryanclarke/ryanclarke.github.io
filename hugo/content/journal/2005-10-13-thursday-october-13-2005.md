A good day.
 I finished Composition 1 today! I had to write this choral piece. It was not fun, and I don't really like how it turned out. But now I'm done! Pedagogy of Harmony starts tomorrow.
 A good day.
 Teresa, Cameron, Garret, and Paul dropped by twice: once at 10:30 for 15 minutes, and once at 7:00 for an hour and we went out to eat. It was so good to see some more Verity folks again. Encouragement. As much as I might be enjoying HQ, I am looking forward to returning to Verity. It was good to see them.
 A good day.
 Ryan
