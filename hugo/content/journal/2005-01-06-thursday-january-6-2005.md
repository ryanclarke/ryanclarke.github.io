So my fever is better but by congested head and irritating cough linger on. And on top of it all, or should I say, near the bottom of it all, my calfs have started aching something terrible. All sore. You should see me waddling around, it must be the funniest sight. You see, it hurts for my calf to stretch. So when it is discomfortable when my foot and shin form an acute angle, I have the recipe for a rediculous shuffle. And believe me, I can dance the rediculous shuffle like a pro. Three others in my family have these sore legs so it seems to be a common feature of the particular bug we have. I must also say that it did pretty well for itself, eight out of eight were infected. So, if you, for some strange reason, think that I'm moaning and complaining here on xanga, you just might be right, because sympathy is a little sparse around here. On the other hand, when someone says, "I know exactly how you feel" they are certainly telling the truth. Wow, all the hidden blessings of a unpleasant experience!
