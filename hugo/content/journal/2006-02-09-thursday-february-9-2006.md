I went snowboarding yesterday. It was really fun, and somewhat scary. I was told I was doing good and picked it up fast. But it seemed the only fast things to me were the speed I was hurtling, and the moment it took to go from standing to sliding. But it was very fun. By the end of the day I had taken almost every hill at the place at least once. I even partially did a wimpy jump: I didn't get any air, but it was enough to make me lose traction with the snow, and I survived without a crash. I had fun.
Did you know that we move our heads slightly from side to side when we walk or run? We I do now because my neck is sore enough to notice. Why? Read the above paragraph. Particularly notice the fact that I got more mileage out of my rear and my forehead than any other single day of my life.
