The blue guy was back. He was wearing the same clothes, down to the capris. He drives a Prius. I should have known it would be a 'healthy' car. I mentioned yesterday that he almost seemed like an alchemist, having discovered this miracle: mangosteen. Well, wait till you see the company name. Here's his business card. I don't know what the word before his name means. I love the email address.

I worked for him all day. We made a lovely powder, and it cleaned up great. And I got off early (relative): 5:00pm.
Life is good, and interesting.
