So far my volleyball team is winning. We won both matches last night. This is going to be a fun tournament.
Papa Shoe was in rare form this morning. Thank you sir.
So it's Valentine's Day today. A day which might become synonymous with romantic stuff somewhere in my future, but which for now means "ice cream and tasty desserts and junk food." Long live 'good' food! I love it.
