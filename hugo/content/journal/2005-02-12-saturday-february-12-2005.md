I'm back in America! It is wonderful to be home. I did not realize how much America meant to me until this trip when I was away for so long. This jet lag thing isn't so bad. I've just been doing great. So, I'll write more about the 4 and a half days of touring later.
 This is probably the best picture of me in China in terms of it being a Chinese background.

 This is not a temple, it is a tea house. Enjoy it.
