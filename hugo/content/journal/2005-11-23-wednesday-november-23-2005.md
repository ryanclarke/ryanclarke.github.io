Check another book off the list: Tender Warrior - God's Intention for a Man by Stu Weber. Very good book. I recommend it for all guys who would like an inspirational and practical look at what it is to be a real man and how to become the real man. Weber says that a real manhood has four pillars: King, Warrior, Mentor, and Friend. The king leads, the warrior protects, the mentor disciples, and the friend loves. All four together provide the godly man: well rounded, complete, and mature. I want to become a God's man's man.
 We were playing this game tonight, Outburst, which involves naming things in certain categories within a time limit. One card my team got was "organizations for young people." I could only think of four: Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, 4-H, and Hitler Youth.
