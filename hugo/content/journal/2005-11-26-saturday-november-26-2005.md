The Reckner's left this morning. We had a fun time with them. I have probably spent the majority of my Thanksgivings with them, and so it was great to do it again.
 I hit some sales today with Mom. Mostly we did Mom Shopping. But we did get to do some Ryan Shopping. As in: Best Buy and Circuit City. At Best Buy I was finally able to use a Christmas gift card from last year: I found a (get ready to be jealous) 1GB USB flash drive for \$20 (\$40 with \$20 rebate). I am so happy. I feel like a materialist letting stuff get me so up like this. But oh well. Finally I found the deal I've been looking for. So now I have all the shopping out of my system for a long time. And Christmas is coming up. So I guess I'll have to go do some more buying soon.
 Ryan
