This is the most recent family picture, taken at the PIX Theater after my symphony was played. Becky is the one on the far right, beside me. She might be the most generous person I know. She is constantly writing people letters, giving them gifts, and even money. It's a real inspiration to me. I might not have much, but she is way more generous with even less. She is also a very happy person (her middle name is Joy). Many of you Verity people have met her the two times she's been up, for my graduation and the symphony concert. I'm sure you'll all agree that she is an awesome person.
Since I guess you didn't have anything to do with being my sister, I want to thank you for being a GREAT sister. Thank you also for all the lessons you've taught me Becky!
Ryan
