I passed Form & Analysis III. We all did. And we all did really well. Dr. Kincaid was very happy. It was a fun course. JRod left tonight to join his family in southern Illinios and start his summer vacation. I'm really going to miss him this summer. I leave tomorrow morning at 6:50. Minna leaves at about 5pm. So, it's all over. I will be writing my next update from home. It will be good to be back there.
