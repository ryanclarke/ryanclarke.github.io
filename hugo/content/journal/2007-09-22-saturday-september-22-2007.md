I arrived back at work after lunch yesterday and found the street completely closed off by emergency vehicles. So the question is, what can possibly happen in Payson which will have 4 fire engines, 3 fire SUVs, 3 police cars, 2 police SUVs, and an ambulance to the scene in 10 minutes? I'll tell you what, a camper trailer fire. Actually, the camper in the storage lot across from my work caught the camper next to it on fire and it burned up some too. The firemen were really excited about this one. I guess the last few weeks have been slow. And that's the news from Payson where enough personnel to overthrow a small country arrive for a refrigerator fire.
