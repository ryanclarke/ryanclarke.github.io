Faas and I drove down to The Valley to pick up some coworkers at the airport. Turns out, they didn't need the pickup. So we went to this nifty, little coffeeshop and then ate at Red Robin. It has been a long time since I've eaten there back in Flint. It turned out to be a good drive.
I can't believe they let us off work early to do all that!
Overheard:
"It'll cost you an arm and a leg."
"Okay, I'll take two."
