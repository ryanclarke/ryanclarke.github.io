My family is fine.
 The hurricaine made a tornado that took out part of Roopville, GA, a town of 600 about 3 miles from us. I think 1 person was killed. Many buildings were trashed. ALERT is senging a team to our area to help out.
 So, my family, and everyone we know are fine. Only strangers were hit. In fact, I don't even think we lost any trees, which is good, because the one 5 years ago took out over 100.
