We all went to the Chinese service at church this morning. My TA from the first week, Steven, and a friend of his, Miller, came also. They'd never been to church before, so it was a neat experience for them. Pray for them as they learn more about God. We sang in the service. It Is Well (all 4) and How Great Thou Art (1 & 4). It was neat to hear the Chinese singing and the whole Chinese worship experience. We had communion also. During the prayer I got to thinking, "Wow, I can't believe God is getting all that! He's keeping up and knowing what's happening." Then I thought, over the next several hours God will be getting worship services coming up to him in a dazzling array of different tongues. And he knows and understands and answers every prayer. Wow, big God.
 This afternoon we went to Xitang, a famous old Chinese town, sometimes called "the Venice of China" because of it's many canals. It was pretty neat. We saw a bunch of neat, old stuff. There was this one rock garden in particular that was incredible. It was this huge rock maybe 30 feet round surrounded by water with a little bridge to the rock path along the waters edge if the 'island.' The rock was about 15 feet tall. All cut through the rock were little tunnels to walk through with a few staircases cut through that came out on the top. On top was a pagota style gazebo. It was pretty neat. Put that in the middle of a small pond, get a canoe or two, and you've got the ultimate boy's paradise. I want one in my back yard. Actually, come to think of it, it was not one rock, but many medium size ones cemented together. Maybe I get one made for my kids (OK, that requires money and kids, which requires a wife. A distant plan.)
 Tonight I went to Mandefu (American-style resturant similar to McDonalds) with Jordan. Then we stopped in for a xiang yu nai cha (Chinese potato flavored milk tea) on the way home. I'm going to turn in. Take care all.
