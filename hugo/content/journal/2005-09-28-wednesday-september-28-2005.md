I'm at HQ. I'm staying in 4008, the house I was praying for. They've got wireless and are very close our classroom. Nice kitchen and nice guys too. Also and ping-pong table and two pianos: a nice one and a honky-tonk, saloon-style piano.
 Class is proving to be fun. No more theory exersizes for me. Emily, JRod and I are taking Composition I, which is just that. We just sit around and compose all day: for dear life. It's not exactly easy, just fun.
 I'll try to keep everyone updated.
 It was good to see Dr. Kincaid again!
