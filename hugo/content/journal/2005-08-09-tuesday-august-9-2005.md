I have trouble writing words. Crafting an essay is endless torture for me. Why am I so often asked to do those things which I so despise? And why do I readily accept the assignments? And why do I complain endlessly about it? And why do I hide those complaints in a joke? Such things are hard to think about. And much, much harder to write about.
