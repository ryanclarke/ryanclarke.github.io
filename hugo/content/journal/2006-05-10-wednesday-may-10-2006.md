Life goes on, ever meandering on it's way towards the future. That's sort of what I feel like I'm doing right now: meandering. But gradually, through the haze, I think I see a shadow rising like a vague herald of the substance behind. Trust in God. Goodness lies around the bend; maybe a hard goodness, but if it's God's perfect place, that's where I want to be.
