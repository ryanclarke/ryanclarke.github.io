I just got home from work and I now celebrate only one more week till Christmas holiday!
Can you tell I'm excited? I've got this galactic countdown going. In fact, my entire life now seems of sorts to be rotating around a countdown. Family, friends, home church, 'MY' GRAND PIANO, not having to wake up at 7:00 every morning so I sleep in till 7:30, Lydia's Birthday, CHRISTMAS, trip to the Reckner's, wonderfulness, homemade eggnog,... All starting in only a week!
