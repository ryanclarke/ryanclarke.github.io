I gave a Symposium speech today about communicating with the Chinese people in China. Callie, Sandy, and Margie also spoke. Callie did a really interesting (and memorable) speech on Chinese food which included many wierd pictures, and so good ones too. She's going to make a good teacher some day. Sandy talked about transportation, and the lack of (obedience to) traffic laws. And Margie took a tourism perspective showing a deluge of pictures from all over China, mostly points of interest. She also through in a number of pictures of cute Chinese kids.
 JRod and Tristan made a 18 minute video of our trip to China that was very good.
 I went to a Buffalo Hot Wings place tonight with Grayson, R.J., Julia, Brooke, Liz, Lawren, and Del. We saw another group of Verity folks there. I had 6 of the 15 flavors. The Blazin' (their hottest) wasn't too bad at all... until one minute later! I don't really mind hot stuff, but I like mild a lot better because I can taste it. The Thai flavor was the best followed by Caribbean Jerk. So, it was a fun night. I haven't had hot wings in years.
 How many people think Bartok is a little wierd? Do you like him anyway?
