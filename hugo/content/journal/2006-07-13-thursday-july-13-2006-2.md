I just got home from work. And it was a long day, as promised. It started out kind of rough with it taking three of us 2 hours to get a feed pump running while a customer waited. But then it kind of settled into the ordinary. Just a lot of ordinary - 13 hours.
I don't mind. I like my job.
These next two day will probably be normal load. Followed by a great weekend!
