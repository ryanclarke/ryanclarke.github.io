A day or two ago, a group of HQ staff girls went out to eat. They went to this little, authentic Chinese place down the road. One of the girls, who works in the kitchen at HQ, got a bug in her meal. She was telling me about it today just before lunch. I assured her, no, bugs are not a usual course over there. At least that I knew. But who knows? I've been wrong before...
 Yesterday I went to a different Chinese restaurant with a group of guys from here. I didn't detect any bugs in my jiaozi. Very tasty.
