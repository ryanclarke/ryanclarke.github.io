Class is good. I think I am getting more accurate. Dr. Kincaid's not going to let me finish till I am getting 100% of the problems 100% right 100% of the time. So, I think I'm getting closer to that almost impossible standard. It's good news, really.
 Current weather outside: 49ÂºF with 15 mph north wind and some clouds.
