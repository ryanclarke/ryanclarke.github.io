I finished the Theme and Variations that I had to write for my course. 1935 notes total. Not counting the incredible amount that I erased. As soon as I get the computer playing it correctly I'll put a copy on here. Assuming that it would tolerably pass as music, even when the computer plays it correctly. So, keep watching for updates.
 In other news, we had the Second Annual Verity Starved Rock Day Pot Luck. Every year the HQ people go to Starved Rock State Park for the day. These last two years we have been here, but unable to go, so we supped together. It was a fun time. I have so many good memories of last year when JRod and I were here with the '05 music girls. Now we've got the '06ers with us. Still fun though. Some of the video clips we've taken are hilarious.
