What if you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel?
What if you're not even sure there is a light?
What if the end of the tunnel might just be the start of another tunnel?
Is it still worth traveling the tunnel to find out?
Is a dream worth fighting for?
Even if it's an outside chance of success?
If Christ is supposed to be life, what do we do with days and weeks?
How do we fit our goals and dreams and everyday life into God's Ultimate Plan?
Why do the people who are going about things the wrong way the people who seem to have it all?
Why does God bless me in all these little ways but seem to withhold the big blessings from me?
Or do I just forget?
I think I'm going to continue to trust God with my life. Incidently, He's the only choice I have. Without Christ is without hope.
