I sent a PLA Proposal in to TESC back in the middle of December to get some credit for Conducting. Yesterday I called to find out whatever happened to it, and they send they never received it, probably lost in the mail. Today I get an email saying to call them so I can get something done with it, meaning that they have now miraculously found my paper. So tomorrow I call to find out what's happening. I knew I had trouble believing the Uncle Sam the Mailman put in someone else's mailbox. Anyway I guess we'll see what's happening in that paper maze there in New Jersey tomorrow. And I'm sure you all hear the TESC is moving offices next week. Now that's going to be a headache.
