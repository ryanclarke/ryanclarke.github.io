Eight and a half hours of expunging glue from stainless steel. You should have seen the arsenal we amassed during the blasting and scouring. At least we know that the glue was gluey. Actually, the material only turns into glue if you injure the powder particles and we had a couple of bad test runs early in the day yesterday (hence the clumpiness from yesterday's post). So, eight and a half hours later today I could have crawled up the wall and across a ceiling like an obnoxious insect. I think.
