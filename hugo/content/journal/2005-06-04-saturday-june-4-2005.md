As JRod commented on my last post, the reason I didn't feel like sharing a funny story was because I had a migraine. So that's why I signed out so quickly. I hate those things. But then again, allergies just create problems. Here in Oak Brook, Illinios the weathers great and the flowers are in full force. So it's just one of those things.
 The other of those things is that I'm enjoying getting to borrow my sister's cellphone for two weeks. Since it is now the weekend I can call up all sorts of friends and talk, assuming, of course, that I have their phone number. So that is very enjoyable. Especially if they are enjoyable people to talk to. Which, of course, are the people I talk to. Most of the time.
 Well, minus the sinus problem last night, Everything is going smoothly and comfortably. And funly!
