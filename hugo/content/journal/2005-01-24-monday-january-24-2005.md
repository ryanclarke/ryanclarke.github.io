Today was the first day of class. I had 23 5-6 graders in the morning. They were very smart and the class went well. There was one guy who was a total cut-up. He thought he was hilarious, the class laughed, and he was a jerk. He sat in the back corner for the last two periods. If he doesn't learn a lick of English, he'll still be far ahead of the others. I think I've got him under control. Then in the afternoon I had a class that wasn't so fast. They were really good and sweet and cute and attentive and eager to learn. I named 13 of the 14. It was fun. I named several of them after my family Edna, Carol, Sarah, Becky, Lydia, Linda, and Amy.
