Competing Love.
 We are told to love God with all our hearts. We are told to love our neighbors (meaning all people) as ourselves. This leaves us in an interesting predicament. If these loves are mutually exclusive then we should love God totally, and ourselves none, and by extension, have no love for our neighbors. This seems to work logically in this tiny instance, but in the larger realm of the Biblical message, it falls short. Therefore, we must be able to love God totally, and still love others (and other things). In short, part of loving God includes, and even requires, other love. And not just emotional love, the kind that intrudes upon you easily; no, the hard, willful love that requires determination. Love the unlovely.
 In short, I loved God today. It was mostly easy: goofing of with Andrew playing. But some was hard love: hey, he smashed my intricate construction! With relish! But, I guess it is his Christmas toy I made it with...
 It was a good day.
