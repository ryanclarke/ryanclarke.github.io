Blake and Carter left this morning. Don't worry, Blake left me stuff to do on service hour. Nice guy. I'm going to miss Blake these next few weeks. In January we tackle China together, along with about a whole posse of other folks.
 So JRod and I are listening to Alexander Borodin's Nocturne from his String Quartet No.2. It's very beautiful music. It has an asymmetrical melody that is full of interesting turns. Borodin was a professional university chemistry teacher. He only wrote world-famous music on the side as a hobby. Like three symphonies, an opera *Prince Igor*, and numerous other pieces like the symphonic poem *In the Steppes of Central Asia*.
 We have room inspections today. I think. So I seriously need to clean/pack/clean. And pack. I leave in just a few days.
