Flint turned 150 years old today. Very exciting. I guess. But they did put on quite a party. And the Verity guys played and sang as a part of musical festivities, which was a really neat opportunity.
 Tonight I'm going to the season opener for the Flint Symphony Orchestra. It's going to be grand. Actually, it may be the last FSO concert I'm able to attend, which is sort of sad when you think of it that way. But mostly it's really happy, because the FSO is good, and the seats a cheap, which is the perfect combination.
 God loves me. I know this. I am blessed.
