Yesterday Pastor Allen gave me a gift certificate to the Phoenix Symphony in appreciation for me filling in for him these last two weeks. I was quite surprised on top of happy. Of all the perfect gifts! So, now I just have to decide what I want to see... and who to bring with me.

In just a few hours I head to the church to begin my long weekend with the youth. We drive through the night, spend Saturday at Magic Mountain riding coasters, Sunday morning at the beach freezing in the water, and then we drive and get back Sunday night. It's 8 hours to Santa Barbara. And 8 hours back.
