IT'S FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH!
I'm feeling lucky.
Pictures of Ghana, including slave fortresses, are available on my [sister's blog](http://www.xanga.com/sarahdipityinlime).
Off to be lucky!

\*\* NOON UPDATE \*\*
Faas said a joke yesterday and our boss heard one sentence and now we have three coworkers unhappy with us.
Then we ended up making chlorine gas (bertholite, not mustard gas) in our dryer room by mistake and could have died. It's the stuff that was used by the Germans at the Second Battle of Ypres in WWI. We learned our lesson.
But we're still feeling lucky.
\*\* END NOON UPDATE \*\*
=======================
\*\* EVENING UPDATE \*\*
Things got luckier after lunch. I had the feed tube melt. Then I turned onto the wrong road when going to the packaging place. And I lost a game of tennis. That's pretty lucky.
\*\* END EVENING UPDATE \*\*
