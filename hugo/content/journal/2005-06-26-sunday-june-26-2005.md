My brother Ben and sister Sarah just got back from a youth camp in Saint Louis. They had a great time listening to lectures by seminary professors all day for a week. So I'm glad for them.
 My sister Lydia and brother Andrew have been doing a lot of firefly collecting. So cute. They sit there and watch the things flash in the little cage.
 What's it like to have family close by? My Dad's sister and her husband moved 30 minutes away about a week ago. They are the first family members we've even had that live close, meaning, we can drive to their house and back in one day. They always have been the closest family, at 600 miles. So this is going to be a new experience, but a good one. We've already had a lot of fun with them. And they came to our church this morning.
 So now I have all my immediate family back, and even some extended family thrown in. Too fun.
