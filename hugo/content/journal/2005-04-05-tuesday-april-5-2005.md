The last biology class was this morning and now I have only a few more days to study. I went to the park with all the folks tonight, it was very fun. It was also the first time I've ever taken a book to park night. So I played goalie, and as my team was very good and kept the ball down on the other end of the field, I could just sit under the metal bar and read biology. I would hop up every so often to grab a stray ball venturing to near my goal.

 I have to study now.
