Do you ever wonder about pictures? I mean, we go to a place, and we want to get a picture in front of the whatever-it-is. And we end up blocking it.
 I was looking through some pictures of China today with Minna and JRod, and in half the pictures you can't even see China because there were these Americans in the way, blocking the view! It was pretty annoying. I can look at myself anytime I want to in the mirror. Why don't I? Because it is extremely boring to look at myself. Sometimes. Other times it is hilarious. So when I look at China pictures I expect to see China.
 The same goes with graduation caps. Those square roofs on top were not designed to let you see the people in the second row. Or the third row. I propose that in this era of modern technology, we should invent a new, media-friendly graduation cap.
