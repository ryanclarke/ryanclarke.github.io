In the New Testament, the word for "patience with people" is makrothumia. It's often translated long-suffering. It literally means, "long fuse" before you blow up. I have a long fuse, but how long is long enough? But what happens when it starts getting shorter? Are you still patient since you used to have a long fuse before some difficult person helped burn it shorter for you?
Maybe, just maybe, I don't have such a long fuse after all. Ever think of that?
