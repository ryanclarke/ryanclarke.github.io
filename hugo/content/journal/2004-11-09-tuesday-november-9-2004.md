Nope, not a geek
I went across the hall to Peter and Paul's room tonight to get my geek lesson. Actually it's an informal thing where I go see what wonders Paul is performing on his laptop. Tonight Paul was quizing me with multiple choice questions off the Windows 2000 MCSA certification exam. (Don't ask me what MCSA stands for.) I got one question right; and the other right also, on the third guess (out of four). So, I'm a certified "non-geek." In computers at least. But I'd like to think I could hold my own in music theory and music history.
 Yes, I have better success with music. Tonight I conducted the Verity Chamber Orchestra in a piece that I composed and which we will be playing at the recital on Friday night. I actually made it the whole way through the piece, twice, without managing to throw of the entire ensemble. Sweet victory. I stood in front of a mirror with Tristan's camcorder running and my computer playing a MIDIized version of the piece for a hour tonight and flapped my arms like a bloomin' idiot. I then had video footage of a guy trying to fly in a dormroom, complete with soundtrack. I felt like shooting the mirror. Actually, I felt like *not* shooting the mirror, but instead conducting towards a blank wall where I wouldn't have instant reply of every mistake. That way I'd have time to justify my errors before facing reality in Tristan's digital wonder. But, by throwing cues at a nightstand and passionately crescendo-ing a windowsill, I managed to get a hang of my left hand. Hint: it is very handy for a conductor to know where is left hand is at all times, especially when conducting. (that sounded like I was trying to crack a cheesy pun: "handy" "hand", but I wasn't) And then it was 8:20pm, orchestra practice time. And I managed to totally confuse 12 fine musicians for 10 minutes before they finally played the piece two times beautifully, and I managed to stay with them. Victory. One more rehearsal till shownight ... and I need it more than the performers! It'll be my grand debut as a conductor!
 And with that, I will go to bed.
