This has been a wonderful weekend.
 Hearing the first two movements of my symphony be played by the Lapeer Civic Orchestra was a extremely neat experience. It marks the first time that one of my pieces have been performed, and I had nothing to do with the performance. People I didn't know were playing my music for people I didn't know. That is neat.
 Also the fact that over 50 friends came to see (and hear) it, including Callie and Sandy who drove up for the night, and my entire immediate family who flew in for the weekend - it was overwhelming, all the support. All the praise and nice words I got afterwards at the post-concert party at Krispy Kreme are very appreciated.
 I am very grateful for all the wonderful friends God has given me, and especially for the dear family I have. I also want to thank those friends who couldn't be there, but without whom this weekend would not have happened: namely JRod. Also the Bullingers, particularly David, whose influence made this a reality. And the LCO for playing my music.
 They say everyone and everything has to start somewhere: this has been one of those 'starts' for me.
 This has been a wonderful, thrilling, inspiring, overwhelming, special weekend.
 And now I am exhausted.
