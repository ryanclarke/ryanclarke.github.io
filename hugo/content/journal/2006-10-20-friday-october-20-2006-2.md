I worked late last night. Then I came home and didn't really sleep until sometime just after 5am. I was at work by 6am and worked till 1:15. So all put together it wasn't a hard couple of days, or long, but I feel kind of weird. The odd hours must be getting to me. Normal hours tomorrow, I think. Being off since 1:15 was nice. But niceness must end. Goodnight.
