So I took this little online quiz at Rachel Smith's request. I don't normally take online quizzes because they are so often wrong, but this one was fairly accurate, I guess. Don't worry, this blog's quality is not going to go downhill from here on.

At Your Highest:
 You are in your normal state.
At Your Lowest:
 You say "oh well" and move on.
In Love:
 You are very encouraging to the couple that's courting.
How You're Attractive:
 You're not. But the love of Christ that is in you can be attractive if you share it.
Your Eternal Question:
 "I have an eternal question?"
