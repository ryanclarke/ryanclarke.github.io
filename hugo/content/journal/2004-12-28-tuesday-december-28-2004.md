Uncle Dave left this morning. The first in the current exodus of relatives leaving our house. I went to the mall yesterday, which is a very rare thing. As in 5-times-ever rare. It's about a hour away. Most of the stores don't sell anything i could possibly ever want (women's clothing, perfume, jewelry, handbags, designer candles, paintings of long dead actresses, etc.). But the food court is very relevent to my life. I got a grilled sub, very tasty. Then we went to Best Buy, I love looking a computer stuff. I'm having a great winter break.
