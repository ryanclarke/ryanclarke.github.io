I'm at the coffeeshop in town. They have high-speed wireless here. I'm here to download updates for my Windows XP and to install my Christmas present: new, up-to-date, anti-virus software.
 Yesterday's post material was resolved today when I registered for the portfolio 1 hour and 37 minutes before the deadline dropped. And I paid the complementary extra \$100 that people get to pay when TESC decides to shuffle the mail around for 5 weeks instead of delivering it to the department the mail was sent to.
 We get pizza tonight!
