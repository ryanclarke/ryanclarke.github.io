I went to the senior recital of these two girls from church, Audria Smith and Katie Hogan. They did an incredible job (or jobs). I was really neat the way they jointly constructed such a neat program from both of their multiple musical talents. I like recitals and concerts.
Prayer is so powerful and important, it would be wise for us to learn better how to engage in prayer. If having a close relationship with God is the ultimate goal of a Christian, then intense prayer should be the ultimate act of a Christian.
