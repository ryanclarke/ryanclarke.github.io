Snowboarding was pretty amazing today. We went to Sunrise Resort near Showlow. I fell a lot, but still managed to have a ton of fun. (I'm sore). I tell you what, those mountains, and that snow, were incredible compared to the trash heap we skied on up at Caberfae in Michigan.
We hit the snow for the Super Bowl. The slopes were empty. Yay!
Faas took some pictures. I forgot my camera in the car.
