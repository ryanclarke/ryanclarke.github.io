Cameron and I cleaned our room really good so we could show it off to the special visitors, and then they never stopped by on their building tour. But we didn't clean in vain, because at least we will benefit.
Mr. Schrader and I went out to eat some good Chinese food at lunch. Good times.
It'll be fun to go to Symposium again this afternoon!
