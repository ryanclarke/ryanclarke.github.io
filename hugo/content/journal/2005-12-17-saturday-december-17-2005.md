It was not what could really be called a fast day. We cleaned. And Ben and I took a colossal load of trash to the dump. Where does it all come from? Some old friends were in town and so we had them over for dinner. And tonight we are going to the church Christmas party at the Dr. and Mrs-Dr. Roger's house.
 My brother Andrew (6) has a lot of energy. He is willing to play gunfight around the house for an entire day straight.
