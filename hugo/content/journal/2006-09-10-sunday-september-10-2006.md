After church, Faas and I decided to take a drive on top of the Mogollon Rim (pron. "muggy-own") - the distinctive terrain feature of our region. In fact, Payson is in the middle of Rim Country. The Rim is the southern edge of the Colorado plateau. It's sort of like a one-sided butte or a one-sided canyon, depending on if you're coming or going. Basically a long inland bluff.
So after stopping for a quick steak at the Christopher Creek Steakhouse, Faas and I set off to ascend the the Rim off to the east. Don't let the picture fool you into thinking the Rim is short, it extends more than 60 miles to the left.

After a drive we finally set foot on top of the Rim. This was my first time to have the Rim at my feet.

Here is the picture you've all been waiting for. Here is my '98 Buick Century Custom that took on the roughest rocks that 60 miles of the Rim Road could litter. This car is suitable for everyone from successful young technical experts to retirees enjoying the very luxuries of retirement. Notice the dusty smear of a true business machine. God provided wonderfully.

And when I say the Rim is rugged, I mean it. Behold the awesome grandeur that Faas and I experienced after we took the wrong trail to the abandoned railroad tunnel and had to back track up a very rigorous powerline easement.

In all, it was a nice drive. Who wouldn't enjoy 60 miles of this kind of view out their left window?

If any of you come to visit, we're taking you to the top of the Rim so you can experience what the pictures cannot fully capture.
