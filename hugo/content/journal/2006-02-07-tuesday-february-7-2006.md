Class is going great! We're moving faster than I expected, but they are catching and understanding it very good. I'm quite pleased so far.
Tomorrow we get to go skiing! I'm going to try my feet at snowboarding, so we'll see how that works.
Tonight I'm going out with Cameron and some other shopping. I might pick up some ski goggles.
