I will mention that I have enough trouble with my sinuses without giving them a positive charge. I wear a dusk mask whenever there is a detectable amount of dust in the air. Breathing action causes there to be a band of dust across the bridge of the nose and the cheeks. When I washed the machinery out though, that's when I got black stuff smeared all over me. I was pretty black everywhere, especially my arms and nose (from the smeared dust band).
Today I did more cleaning, but it was of a cleaner sort, for me. I got out early at 12:30 and spent most of the afternoon looking for rental houses, since I'm not finding any apartments. I'm thinking about [Gillette Castle](http://dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/images/gilext1.jpg), but the cost of moving it here from Connecticut is prohibitive.
