I'm home!
 I've already had Chick-fil-A.
 I've already been tackled repeatedly by Andrew (6).
 I've already talked to Mom for an hour and a half.
 I've already ridden in a car that Sarah (16) was driving with her new licence.
 I've already been to the coffee shop in town where we have wireless. I'm here now.
 I'm home, finally.
 Ryan
