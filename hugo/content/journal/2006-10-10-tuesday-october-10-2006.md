I guess that 'post' yesterday was pretty funny. It seems like most of you all just kept hitting the "OK" button. I didn't realize that the link was going to create a loop like that. Oh well. That was my attempt at an interactive blogpost.
Faas and I got to play tennis tonight for the first time in a long time. Fun as always. And the weather here is really getting cool. I bought a gray knit hat tonight since the blue one I made is back in Georgia.
