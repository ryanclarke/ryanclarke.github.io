Tonight is the biggest, most lavish party in the Verity calendar: The Holiday Banquet. We all get together in the ornately decorated ballroom and eat Italian-ish food while wearing our absolute fanciest clothes. Also included is a whole parade of people who get on stage and take turns showing off: some of them making us laugh our silly heads purple. While we're eating in our "goodly apparel" (James 2:2). So it should be a very fun night.
