What a scare. I just got a bill from the power company saying they were going to turn off the lights in three days. Somehow I missed the bill from last month. So I have quickly fixed that situation. We need power: my laptop's batteries only last 20 minutes.
Next up on my schedule: sleep and then work followed by sleep and then work.
