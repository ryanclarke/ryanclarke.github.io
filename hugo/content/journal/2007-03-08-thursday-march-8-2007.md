So Faas is back in Reno. It's just me here now. I've got plenty of solitary pursuits to keep me busy, but it's always nicer to know there's someone around, someone nearby. Loneliness is never fun, even when it's subconscious. I'll manage.
This website is amazing: [TweakGuides.com](http://www.tweakguides.com/TGTC.html). The ultimate source for getting the most out of your system.
These are good verses:
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. We love Him, because He first loved us. 1 John 4:10, 19
I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. John 10:10b
Anyone interested in some abundant life?
Ryan
