I'm home!
I arrived back in Atlanta yesterday afternoon. My family treated me to a Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich and a Quik Trip frozen cappuccino before we went home. I love my family.
The night before I left the Rodriguezes had a youth meeting at their house. I got a picture with JRod and Victor. Victor is a really neat guy that I'd met and hung out with on several occasions during the week.

They sky was finally clear enough on the drive back to the airport to get a picture of the saddleback mountain. This is the most famous Monterrey landmark. As I left Mexico to this vista, so will I leave you with this image.

The Rodriguez family is great. They made it so much fun for me to be there in Mexico. Really opened up their home to me and also to all the people whom they minister to. It was great to be with JRod again.
That was an incredible trip.
