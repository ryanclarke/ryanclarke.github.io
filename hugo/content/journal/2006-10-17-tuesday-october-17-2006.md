It's almost like being off work. Except that I have to go to work now. I got the day off. Sort of. We have so much stuff to get dried these three days that Faas and I are working in sort of shifts. He went in at 8, and now I get to go in at 4 and work really late. The good news is that I was able to play some organ since I was off when the Episcopal Church next door was open. Now I'm going to try to find a piano before I have to be at work in a little while. I'm going to look up at my church, Ponderosa Baptist. \*edit\* The church was closed. Oh well. I guess I'll have to go between 9 and noon someday. Such short hours. \*end edit\*
On a personal note, Faas and I have recently crossed a milestone. We finished the first family package of napkins and I opened the second package today.
