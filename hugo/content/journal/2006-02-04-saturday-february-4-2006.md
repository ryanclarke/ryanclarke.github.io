It was one of those days when nothing gets done and you look back at it with satisfaction. Not that I enjoy being unproductive. Just these next 2 months are going to be so long and tiring, that I'm appreciating any rest I can get.
"Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you." Acts 13:41
Let us not be despisers. Let us welcome the Lord's mighty work: a work so large we couldn't believe it if we were told!
