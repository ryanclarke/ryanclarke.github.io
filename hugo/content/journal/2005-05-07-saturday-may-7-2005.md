Yesterday I passed American Literature. That means I'm done with every CLEP and DANTES test I need for my degree. Basically, I'm done testing. The last test was fun, I sort of enjoy tests. So now the weekend is free until I have to start working on all the music stuff I have yet to do.
 And let me tell you, it's a great feeling.
 Wish me well, people!
 Ryan
