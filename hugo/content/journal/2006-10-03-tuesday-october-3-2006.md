Corn Steep Liquor smells like spaghetti-O's. Trust me, I know. And it's making me hungry. We're drying it to be used as a feed supplement for cows. Question: powdered steepwater is a supplement to what? Actually, we haven't dryed much yet, we're still in the try to dry stage. We haven't had much success yet.
I tell you what it is good for: ruining watches. Mine is a wrist-strap white noise machine. Make that "black noise:" No display, but it give off an annoying bubbling sound. Go figure.
Off to cook some spaghetti-O's.
