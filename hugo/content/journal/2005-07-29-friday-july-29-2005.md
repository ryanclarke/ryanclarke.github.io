Today is Christmas.
 At least, it is for the Tiawanese students that are here. Part of the American culture that they are learning involves celebrating different holidays.
 Today is Christmas.
 I was invited to their Christmas banquet tonnight, which includes a christmas pagent. And afterwards I'm going ice skating with them. What a fun time of year! And this year I get it twice. Because...
 Today is Christmas.
 I'm having a hard time believing it. But it is grand. I hope you are having fun, no matter what time of year you are in.
