All those answers were good. Jesus came to earth for many reasons: to save us, to be an example, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim hope to the captives, to fulfill ancient prophecies, etc. However, it is interesting what Jesus Himself ultimately said His reason for coming to earth was. While on trial before Pilate, and indeed, before the entire world Jesus made this statement in John 18:37b.
"To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice."
Jesus came to testify to the truth. What an interesting and powerful statement. I think it brings real clarity to all of His other reasons for coming. And this is just one more reason that we should fight the pernicious heresy so prevalent today: "Truth is relative," or even worse, "there is no such thing as Truth" We fight it with Truth.
Truth is reality from God's perspective.
