Fun day.
 We had Thanksgiving dinner today. Mom did great on the turkey: it wasn't dry at all. Then we had the pies for dinner. It's one of few lasting family traditions (Est. 2001). That way we have time for the meal to wear off so we have more room for the desert. I highly recommend it.
 Thanksgiving = happy togetherness with family and family friends.
 I didn't hit any of the sales today.
