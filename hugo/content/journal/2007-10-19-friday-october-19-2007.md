I cooked myself a nice, juicy, ribeye steak last night after marinating it for 3 days. And I had mashed potatoes. I just figured I'd let you all know.

I met the girl who's dad painted the Herbie in my town. Her name was Emerald.

It looks like Intel is going to phase out their single-core processors at the beginning of next year. Only dual- and quad-core will be available. And I doubt AMD will hold onto single-core much longer. It's a good thing. I'm looking forward to the consumer-priced quad-core 45nm PSUs that Intel has coming next February, although I'm not sure I'll get one. It's definitely an interesting time on the PC hardware front as we're finally starting to see the effects of Vista on hardware design. (That statement is not completely true, but that's a reasonable consumer perspective on the trend.) Also, [Ubuntu 7.10](http://www.ubuntu.com/) just came out yesterday. I'm downloading it today.

1111 days bloggin for me.
