I can still say I've never been pulled over by the police.
I was driving home from church tonight and I saw a car turn onto my road at the stop sign just down a little bit. So I swung into my driveway before him with plenty of room. Or so I thought. That is was my driveway, that is. I had pulled into my neighbor's drive. The white SUV drove down and stopped in the road at the foot of the drive. By the way, the drives are only about 20-30 feet long. So I figured it must be them, till I saw the "Police" written on the door. I was thinking, he must be writing down my number, what for I didn't know: I was reckless, and I didn't know it was a crime to turn in at your neighbor's. Then we walks over shining a flashlight, so I turned the car off and open the door. He asked me my name and then for ID. So I promptly and honestly and non-threateningly answered. Then he said into his mic, "I don't think he's 50." By the way, I'm not 50. He thanked me and left. They were on the lookout for a car like mine since the 50s guy driving it had been in a fight. So I backed out and pulled in at home.
And that's the news. He didn't even ask to smell the vanilla ice cream and chocolate cake on my breath.
