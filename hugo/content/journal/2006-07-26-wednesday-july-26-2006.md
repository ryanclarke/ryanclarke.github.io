The Boss left town for two and a half days. We're not doing any drying these days. So Faas and I are free to do OFFICE WORK! Yay! So that should make for an interesting two days.
On a personal note, I wore water shoes to work today. I rolled up my work slacks and I washed the machine with lot's of water. It seemed beachy in spite of the large quantities of stainless steel. And the total lack of sand.
