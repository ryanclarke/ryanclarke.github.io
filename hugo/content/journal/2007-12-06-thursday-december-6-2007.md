I made it back to Georgia about 24 hours ago. Sarah and I left Arizona a week ago Thursday and 2001 miles, 7 days, and 11 states later we made it home. Of course, you may be thinking that a week is a long time for such a drive and you're right. We stopped for a day in Kansas for Mama Shoe's memorial service and two days in Kentucky visiting the Reckner's. So it was a leisurely trip. The last day was the most eventful. We were hardly 5 miles from the Reckner's when the rear passenger tire totally disintegrated. We had to unload the entire trunk to get the jack and the spare out and that when I discovered that the included jack was totally useless for changing the rear tire. Fortunately Mr. Reckner had a bottle jack and was able to help me get changed to limp into town and get a new tire. It took a while so we didn't head for home until mid-afternoon. But we're back and it's great to be with family again.

Now I'm looking forward to the next step, whatever it is. All this has kept me crushingly busy so I'll probably take a short breather and then start pursuing my future again with anticipation. There are these little dreams we all have, and maybe some of mine will start to come true. By "little" dreams, I mean those impossibly magnificient ideas that we harbor so close to our soul until they become a living part of us. Life isn't always easy, but it's terribly exciting.
