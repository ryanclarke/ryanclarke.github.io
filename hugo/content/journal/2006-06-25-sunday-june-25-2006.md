- Today I went to a church that I liked and met many nice people.
- Today I scaled a mountain and sat in a cave.
- Today I took pictures on a flash card that is being ignored by my computer.
- Today I am thinking in Shakespearean English because I watched and enjoyed the Hamlet with Mel Gibson. From which, has been, this post, translated.
- Today I celebrate 630 days on xanga.
- Tomorrow I start a new week along with the rest of Payson, minus the Motor Vehicles Department.
- Tomorrow I will see for the first time in almost a month someone I have known for more than a month: Josiah Faas.
- Tomorrow the Big Boss arrives for a few days at the plant.
- Tomorrow my new work uniforms should arrive. I hope.
- I celebrate 631 days on xanga.
