The last of the relatives left this morning, so now it's just the family. Not that relatives aren't family... you understand. And now that it's just the family, I have only 4 days of break left. What an encouraging thought. Well, no. As ready as I might be to start working on my degree *again,* I'm not at all ready to leave home *again*. So, here I am, trying to figure how how to bring up all my new Christmas stuff without leaving any 'old' have-to-haves.
