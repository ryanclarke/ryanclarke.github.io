So I'm working. Well, generally speaking, I'm working. I've never done one of those "Currently etceteraing..." things before, but this time I thought it was appropriate. I have to read it and then write a paper on it for the whole ACE deal. It's quite interesting. So I'm enjoying myself and being productive.
 I lost two games of pingpong to Garret last night: 18-21 and 15-21.
 Visitation Weekend I starts today. VWII is next weekend.
