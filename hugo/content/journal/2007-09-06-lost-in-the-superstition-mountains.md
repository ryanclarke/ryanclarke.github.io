I went out with some friends from church on Sunday and Monday. We went off-roading into the mountains east of Phoenix and camped the night. It was a rugged adventure. Unfortunately, the story doesn't make much sense without images and my camera was one of the first things the wilderness claimed. Two other guys had cameras and took pictures and videos of most of the whole thing. So when I get a hold of some evidence, I'll tell my once-in-a-lifetime (I hope!) tale.

Until then, travel in pairs - or more.
