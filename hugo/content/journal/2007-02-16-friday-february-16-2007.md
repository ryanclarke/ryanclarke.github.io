My life feels melancholy these last days. Which is bum considering tomorrow. I'm getting shaken from many directions. This is unnatural for me.
I'm taking a quick lunch break. Then it's back to work. I'm cutting out early because I leave this afternoon to go on the winter weekend retreat with the church youth. Hopefully I can make a Godly impact with some of these kids. I guess God can still use us when we're low.
Do you ever get that feeling that you could be happy getting your own way, even though God's way is "theoretically" better? I do. I end up hoping God rules in my favor, rather than praying that I'm in His favor.
I bought a ticket to go to Garret and Julia's wedding, so I'll see some of you there. That's an exciting thing to anticipate! Note to self: RSVP soon. I'm still working on some logistics of after I arrive.
