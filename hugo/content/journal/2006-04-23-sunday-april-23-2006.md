The cookout last night was great. It actually was a gathering of 5 families that used to get together quite often. In recent years they've gone separate ways, but they all were back in town for this little reunion with a lot of people.Â  I had a fun time. Several of the people spoke some English, but mostly I just listened to everyone talk and joke in Spanish. The food was delicious. The steak was incredible, and the other things were good too. Here's a picture of some of us guys (and a few girls) at the cookout. The guy on my right is Hector, an awesome guy.

Today we went to HOPE, the Rodriguezes church. Mr. Rodriguez preached a fabulous sermon about relating to and helping other people. JRod translated for me.
In a little while JRod, Mr. Rod, and I are heading out to a town about 3 hours away to bring some folks back home, and to spend the night. We'll be back sometime tomorrow.
