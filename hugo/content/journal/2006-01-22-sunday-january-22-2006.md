This was my last Sunday at my home church for a few months. I'll be there again in April.
 I found a turtle shell today. No turtle. He'd gone on to his reward at the Big Reptile House at that Great Zoo In The Sky (past the dolphin show and around the corner from the petting zoo, first left, near the apemen, you can't miss it).
 Mom made "Cowboy Sandwiches" for the first time in years. Or at least, that I've been home to enjoy them. I love those (pinto beans and cheese and Taco Bell sauce in a tortilla) things!
