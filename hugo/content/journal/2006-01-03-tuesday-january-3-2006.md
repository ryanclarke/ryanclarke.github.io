It was a great day.
 How else can you explain the awesome sessions?
 Or the incredible tips in the conducting class?
 Or the vigorous hike to the waterfalls with climbs straight up and down steep rocky areas. And oh!, the beauty at the bottom! We visited to parts of this gigantic series of falls. Majestic. The smell of water, the misty breeze, the setting sun framed by two ridges shooting a rich, glowing sliver of light and illuminating the turbulent waters like a constantly shattering chandelier scattering myriad rainbows. It was gorgeous. David Prentice has a extremely nice camera, so I hope to get some fine shots of the sight on here sometime. I wish you could have been there and seen it with me live.
 I think the plan tonight is volleyball, maybe. Got to run!
