Yesterday was the first Valentine's day I'd ever celebrated. We don't do anything at home for it, and the other two years I was here at Verity I didn't participate either for various unrelated reasons. So this year marked my first observance.
It was fun.
We played a Verity version of the Amazing Race. I was the leader of Team 10 (yellow). Team 10 was the loser. It's very funny in retrospect.
