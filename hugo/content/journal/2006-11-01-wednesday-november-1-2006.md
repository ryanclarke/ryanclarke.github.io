So I've been receiving a lot of comments recently about my new profile picture. Bewildered comments. No one knows what it is? Oh dear, by graphics design skills must be worse than I thought. And I can't blame color-blindness this time...
As a sort of imprecise poll, please indicate whether you know what it is (e.i. "yes" or "no" or "83% sure").
