My family left yesterday morning. So they are back in Georgia. It was great having them up, and now I won't see them again for two months. They are going to be busy months.
Today I am going to be helping out with this huge conference going on.
One year ago today I was my one appearance on TV - and it was in China. I was making and eating my first jiaozi with Micah King in a little, old Chinese woman's house while the camera rolled. It was fun. [My post](http://www.xanga.com/classicalRyan/197117750/item.html) from February 1st, 2005.
One year ago today with my teaching assistant Rachel on (what we American's called) Watermelon Street.
