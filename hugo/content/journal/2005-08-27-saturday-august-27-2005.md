I'm in Holland, MI sitting in the Hope College Library. Just figured I'd be a true xanga-ite and post something. Off to find the rare books section! Yes, this is going to be a fun day. By the way, I'm not going to spend the whole day in the library, I'm just checking in as a matter of duty. Or whatever.

More later.

Congradulations to all the runners in the CRIM, especially my roommate JRod,Â who made it the whole 10 miles. Way to go!
