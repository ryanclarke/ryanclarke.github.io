I was talking to my brother Ben on the phone today. I love him, I mean, he's my brother after all. But I'm proud of him too. With my parents I definitely love them. But I think with my siblings pride trumps love. I guess it's part of being the oldest.
Ben can play circles around anyone on a clarinet.
And he can certainly outdo me on the piano.
He sings better.
He can light me up in paintball.
He's better with animals.
He can be with people who are acting totally foolish and not lose his composure.
He's stronger.
I think I'm still faster though.
And I always could make a better bow and arrow.
Be he was a better archer.
He can fix an engine.
He can build a house. I'm sure.
But I was a better Legos builder.
He can run an entire week-long day-camp for inner-city Atlanta gang kids all summer.
He is the best foosball player I know.
He can pass advanced calculus his first semester at college, and he was the one who hated math.
He's a hard worker.
And no, it's not his birthday. I just felt like telling the world, "That's my brother."
By the way, my sister Sarah had a violin solo at some big concert tonight. Wish I could have been there.
