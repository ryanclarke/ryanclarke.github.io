We had two customers in today. We were running test for them on a new product of theirs. We started out making this clumpy powder that they hated. But by the time we finished our 32 different dryer test conditions, we were making better powder than they had made in their lab. So it was a good day. Successful. Happy customers make me happy.
And one of the guys looked like Charles Bronson ("Danny" in The Great Escape and "Bernardo" in The Magnificient Seven).
