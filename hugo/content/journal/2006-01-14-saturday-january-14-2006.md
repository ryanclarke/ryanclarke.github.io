So I just wrote out the little bio of me that is going to appear on the programs. The one that says "Ryan is a super-duper grand ol' guy, but young. And he's also nice, he says, and I quote (with permission), "I'm nice too." And he can change light bulbs and brush his teeth and tie his shoes and write this symphony, now for an unlimited time only low price of practically free (in fact, free). Having received a M.R. degree (no marriage necessary, color and/or shape may vary), he's currently planning to live forever or die trying. You may refer to him as 'sir.' For directions call 1-800-THE-LOST. Keep out of reach of children."
OK, For the real bio come to the concert. Also, it contains secrets about me that you probably already know.
 Ryan
