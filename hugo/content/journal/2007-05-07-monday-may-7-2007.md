And we have 3 correct answers to last post's question.
The giveaway was the word 'passive:' passively waiting on God. God never intended for us to be doing nothing. So I'm thinking, maybe that whole idea that God answers our prayers, "yes," "no," and "wait" is not quite correct. Maybe it's "yes," "no," and "something else for now." It seems like I'm doing the 'something else' a lot. But it the end, the 'something else' is the life story, and the other things we wanted were simply distracting rabbit trails. Maybe the detours God keeps throwing out are really the main path.
For some reason, that is not as encouraging a revelation as I think it should be.
