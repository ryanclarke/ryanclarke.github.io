I must have started something when I posted my meditation commentary. It seems like quite a few others have popped up on other xanga sites since then. Each is so different and fits the person who wrote it. I must admit that it would be rather interesting to be the grader, to see each person's personality come out in their writing. My lack or grmmer is com ut in mine write. An mu bads speuilng ang typeng.
