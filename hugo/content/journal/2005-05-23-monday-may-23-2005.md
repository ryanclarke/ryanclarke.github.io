Canoeing = fun
 Canoeing + '05 class = rainy
 And so the equations go. I had a blast. Strickler and I were in a canoe together and we were doing really good. We were very successful in our canoemanship going up the river. On they way down I was induced to help out two girls who were having trouble with their indian on the way upstream. See [Beki's blog](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=WillowMaid). So I floated Sarah and Callie back downstream with my mad canoe skills: basically, try not to crash. What is it about a nice relaxing ride gown a river in a canoe that is so enjoyable? Probably the ease of not having to paddle very hard after bucking the current going up. I love water.
 Cloudy nights are the best becaus then the fading sunbeams reflect around and creates a more interesting kaleidoscope of colors. So the chance of rain during the day brings a chance of glory at dusk.
 The Verity Chamber Orchestra sounded amazing at rehearsal tonight. I am really happy with how they are playing my piece. It's going to be so fun on Wednesday night when they play it as a part of the graduation week festivities. Thanks all.
