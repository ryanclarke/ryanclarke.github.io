"We do not fully realize the depth of God's mercy because we have never seen Hell."Â  \~ [Mr. Les Means](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=eyemeansit)
 I leave for home at 4:00PM today! Since I will not be having a Spring Break, I want to see my family before my final, busy months at Verity start: on March 14. I will probably be back on Wednesday evening. So this is just a short mid-week excursion to the south. See you all soon. And if you *want* to see me off (translation: *I* want you to see me off) then assemble in the lobby at 4:00pm.
