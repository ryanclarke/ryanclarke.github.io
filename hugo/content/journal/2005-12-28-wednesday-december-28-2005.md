Sometimes life stares you in the face, and you can stare right back. Other times you have to choose to stare back.
 Even when we have no clear direction for enough of our future to suit our security, we can still step out on the day God has shown us. "Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof." (Matt. 7:34) So I am stepping out with confidence, even though I have no idea where it will lead. God show me where I should go at each next step!
 No, I am not lost. I'm learning to trust God. There are a lot of Psalms on waiting on the Lord, I am in danger of beginning to understand what they mean.
