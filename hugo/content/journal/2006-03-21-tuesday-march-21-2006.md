Today is my parent's 25th wedding anniversary. They are the best parents I could have. The Lord knew what he was doing when he gave them to me, or should I say, when he gave me to them.
Today a lot of my good friends left to go to Romania for 2 weeks. I'm excited for them. I sort of wish I was going too.
I had an impromptu in Symposium today. This marks the 10th time I've had a speech (of any type) in Symposium.
It's a good day.
Ryan
