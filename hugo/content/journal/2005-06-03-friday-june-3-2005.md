So the first week of Form & Analysis III is done. We did a lot. We analyzed Ravel's Sonatine, Debussy's String Quartet, and started on Franck's Symphony. The rest of the class will be spent working on the Franck. It has been a fun time.
 I miss all the Verity folks already. I guess it's because I'm stuck in a place where I'm not at Verity and not at home. Also, because I have great friends. I can't wait to get home and spend some time with my family. My siblings have really grown up in the last year and a half. Sarah just turned 16 on Thursday.
 I was planning on sharing a funny story that happened today. But nothing that funny happened today. So I'm shutting down for the night.
