I like spring: it reminds me of fall.
Tonight I thinked we proved Ralph Waldo Emerson wrong when he said, "In the morning a man walks with his whole body; in the evening, only with his legs." This evening we surely put some spirit into our darkening saunter. Lively conversation proved our conclusion that Verity has some of the most interesting people you can meet. The fresh, breezy air did a lot to clear my tired mind and stuffy lungs and enable me to dive back into biology refreshed.
