I am back.
84 hours - total
42 hours - traveling
    21 hours by car
    4 hours by plane
    17 hours waiting in the airport for a plane
42 hours - other
    21 hours sleeping
    21 hours awake (only 1 quarter of the trip)
I started in in Flint, MI and flew to Atlanta where I was picked up by my family and driven to KY where we went to Evansville, IN to watch a bull riding competition that evening. I started in a Great Lakes state, flew to a southern Atlantic state, and then drove back up to a Great Lakes state: all in one day.
It was a fun vacation but the sitting in the airport wasn't the fun part.
I arrived in 10 minutes before my volleyball game started. We won the entire tournament! Go Bullies!
