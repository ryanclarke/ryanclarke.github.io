"What have you done, Faas?"
"I had to change my post over to my cool font."
"Your font stinks."
"No, it's cool."
"But it's dumb."
"Hey, does your supermachine have my cool font? I thought so."
"I'm serious Faas."
"No no, Ryan. I'm serious."
"Faas."
"No no, Ryan. I'm serious. You don't want to fight with me. I get violent, or even noisy. Neighbors: 'Ah, police? I have to report a situation...' I'm serious."

"\*burp\* That's what I think, Ryan."
