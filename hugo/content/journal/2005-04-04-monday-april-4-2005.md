I am really busy.
 This morning I taught a class on evolution to the Verity folks. It was very interesting. I taught the whole thing as if it was fact and true. So, I wonder if I'm going to get some crazy looks now. I think people wonder if I really believe all that stuff. Anyway, it was a fun class to teach, and maybe just a little bit funny. And the support from friends who aren't even taking the class but came to watch me speak: very nice.
 My life is so good right now. Everything seems to be going great, but it's piling on fast. Somehow I have to manage to get a skit ready for tomorrow and a piano lesson ready for Thursday. And on top of that I need to study biology hard enought to pass the test.
 "Life is better than you think it is, if you think it isn't." \~ Ryan Clarke. It's amazing how we can so often get to thinking that life stinks because one little thing goes wrong, when we forget everything good that God has done. And often that one 'piece of bad' is really a part of God's 'piece of good' for us.
