If any of you think of it, pray for my sister Sarah (16) starting at 10:10am Wednesday morning. She's getting her wisdom teeth yanked out tomorrow. She's going to go under general anesthesia. Both Ben and I did local.
 I went shopping with Mom today for the whole afternoon. It was a very good time of togetherness. I love Mom.
