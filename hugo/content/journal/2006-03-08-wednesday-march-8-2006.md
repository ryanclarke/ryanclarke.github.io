I think I'm starting to see a pattern: Wednesdays are the long, hard ones. I love music theory, I love teaching, and I love my students (we have tons of laughs in class). But on Wednesday, as afternoon becomes late, I just can't wait for class to be over, for some reason. Whew, I'm glad I got this week's Wednesday out of the way. I'm excited about tomorrow because it should be a good day!
