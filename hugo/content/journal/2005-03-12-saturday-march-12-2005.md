I went to Birch Run today. I had never been there before. Everyone says it's the greatest place. Well, it isn't. Basically, it's just a bunch of clothing stores stuck together. How dumb. There was also a Border's bookstore, the only worthwhile shop. It was a lot of fun because I was with friends.
 Tonight we had a recital for the '06 music students. They did a great job. It takes a lot of work on the parts of many people to put on a show like that. I have another recital to attend tomorrow. Hooray!
 Last night I stayed up until 3:30 AM waiting for Luke Bushatz to arrive. Read [Callie's Xanga](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=ThePerfectWoman31) to hear the whole story. So I had a roommate for the night. It was fun. I guess the whole Bushatz crowd headed home for real today. I'm tired.
 This has been "My Life: As I See It"
