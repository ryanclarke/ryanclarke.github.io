We made enough money at the church yard sale to send all the youth students on the retreat to California! It was quite a success, but I'm pretty tired now. Okay, very tired. Filling in for Pastor Allen is not an easy job. And tomorrow I'm teaching Sunday School for him too.

Also tomorrow I plan to swing by the 37th Annual Old-Time Fiddlers Contest. How could I miss something like that? It's a busy weekend.
