"I'm not going to lie to you Ryan, your music sucks."
These are the composers from whom I had just finished playing selections: (alphabetically arranged) Albeniz, Bizet, Bruch, Chabrier, Dvorak, Granados, Ippolitov-Ivanov, Liszt, Mozart, Ravel, Rodrigo, Rossini, Sarasate, Suppe, Traditional Polish folk, Verdi.
And he throws out centuries of music across 3 continents like that. So he can listen to Old Crow Medicine Show. Enjoy your "Man of Constant Sorrow," I'm going to engage in some buoyant Respighi. Just another of our many discussions.
Last night I watched "The Cross and the Switchblade." It is a powerful movie about a young, small-town Pennsylvania preacher who went to the inner city of New York to witness to the gangs. It's a true story. Very good movie. God can change anyone. Everyone needs Him. What a hopeful message we bring, and so often against such strong opposition.
