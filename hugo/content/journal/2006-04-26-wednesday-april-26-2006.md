We took another bike trip through the city. This time we rode for an hour. What a crazy traffic system. You basically take your life in your hands when you venture out into the streets. We had a fun time.
I get to tour the school that JRod taught at these last months. It's a really nice place.
We went to a pizza buffet for lunch, a late lunch at 3pm. It's quite a bit different than the pizza buffets in the US. They had salad, and this special root, and fried chicken, and some good potatoes, and three different pizzas. Plus other assorted foods. It was good.
Sorry, no pictures from today.
