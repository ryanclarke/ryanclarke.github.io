Soccer is a great game. I was just about spent when we got through today. I had a few good moves, which made me happy. Cleats are very important, especially in long, wet grass.
 A thought to remember when playing soccer: the ball is not as important as the individual you are about to paste out onto the ground. I sometimes forget it, but that's when bad things happen. Fortunately, the Lord has kept me from hurting anyone during some of the foolish stunts I've pulled.
