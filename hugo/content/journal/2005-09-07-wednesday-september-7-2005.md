I was very challenged by Dr. Castelino's talk this morning.
 One thing that I have thought of quite a bit, but have never been able to express quite right is the idea of grey areas. He put is so well when he said that determining what is right is not so much finding the line between good and bad, but trying to be as close to Christ and far from the world as possible. Very powerful. It is quite a shift in thinking: now Christ becomes the standard that we jusge ourselves by, and not the ever-shifting world.
 I think one other thing that we should watch out for is not only the position of where we are on the scale between the world and Christ but also the direction that we are heading on the scale. Someone with high standards that is chasing the world is not more spiritual than a new Christian trying to follow Christ. I would also say that the fairly worldly but growing Christian is in a better spot with God than the steady Christian who has become stationary and stagnant.
 What a challenge for me to be close to Christ, and getting closer!
 I want to be the friend of God, like Abraham in James 2:23. That requires being really close.
