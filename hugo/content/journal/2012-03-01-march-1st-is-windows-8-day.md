So there I was...

I'd "known" that the Windows 8 Consumer Preview was coming out in February since //build/ in September. I'd known it was going to be on the "congratulations for surviving 4 more years, here's 24 bonus hours" day since early in the month. I'd known that the download would be finished by quitting time since I started it that morning (it's a slow hose).

I popped the install disk into my little old laptop-a sacrificial gesture so that any weird issues wouldn't effect my main battletower-and would you know it: I'd done it again. On this First day of March in the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand Twelve, Windows 8 Consumer Preview dawned for me. The laptop did not spend quality time with me last evening: it communed instead with the Personal Backup Solution™. For the third Windows release in a row, I have completely forgotten to backup my marked-for-destruction hard drive until the cheeky little installer asked what partition I'd like to feed it.

Moral: It should have been April 1 today. And Windows 9 will probably get me too.
