Things I didn't do today:
 Give that section of the house a second coat of paint.
 Things I did do today:
 Bring the garbage to the dump.
 Clean the bathroom.
 I guess I did some of the 'dirtier' things. It was drizzling out, so it was a bad day to paint. It was also a bad day to go to the dump, but that didn't matter.
 I watched Lawrence of Arabia tonight. It was a good movie. Very interesting. And the hero is not perfect at all, he has his flaws and his incredible points. He basically becomes a legend by doing a whole series of impossible feats as a leader, but he leans in and out of insanity more and more as the film progresses. It's really neat to see a 'honest' portrayal of a flawed hero.
