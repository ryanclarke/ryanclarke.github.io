I have never been so excited about going to a grocery store before. Faas and I got off work and (party!) we went to buy food. And we got Starbucks. You have to celebrate the weekend somehow.
Look what I found in the ceramic liquid we dried today. Quick quiz: Do any of you know what it is? (answer tomorrow)

I like the fuzzy look (even though this artifact is not fuzzy). Sort of like what 1940's b&w film looks like when they zoom in on the girl and the violins start adding extra vibrato. You know what I mean.
