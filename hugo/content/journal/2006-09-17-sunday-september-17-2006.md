Faas and I got to play futbol today with a bunch of Mexicans over at Rumsey Park, the same place we play tennis. It was really fun to get out on the field and kick again. I held my own pretty well, which both surprised and pleased me.
Pastor giving announcements this morning:
"I hope you were more in love with Jesus when you came in than when you leave."
Umm, oops.
