Here it is: finally done.
 [Sonatina No. 2 in Bb Major](http://www.ryanclarke.net/music/Sonatina2inBb.MID)
Ryan Clarke                 5:52
 1. Allegro con moto ..... 2:10
 2. Andante amabile ..... 2:00
 3. Allegro brioso ......... 1:37
 Sorry if it seems clunky or mechanical, I will blame the computer for that.
 Enjoy my work!
 Ryan
