Merry Christmas!
My family is preparing to leave the Reckner's to drive home in just a few minutes. So we're going to spend Christmas on the road. Hacking phlegm. We all have the fever. And I don't handle sickness very well: no peaceful acceptance as just one of those things, more of a desperate clinging to the hope I may someday recover.
It makes me think of Jesus as I'm far from home and feeling pretty much totally not like my normal self. He spent His Christmas far from home and 'family' when he left heaven. Also, His very finite infant's body must have been somewhat unnatural for an eternally unlimited God. We even sometimes call Him "Man of Sorrows." Maybe this illness and journey will give me more appreciation for the sacrificial nature of Jesus' birth (and life).
It's funny, but in spite of the ailing, I've had a great Christmas. God is good. Merry Christmas All!
Ryan
