I just lost my post, so here is my second try. More briefer.
 Went skiing yesterday. At an old landfill called [Caberfae Peaks](http://www.caberfaepeaks.com/). Had fun. Took 30 jumps good and got major air. Took one jump bad. Currently walking with a swagger that favors my right hip. The jump that got me is on the bottom left in the picture below. The first time I took it was perfect and I swerved over and got the middle pictured jump also. The second time... I landed on my wallet aways farther down the hill after a long flight. It was fun though. Had to be careful to miss the snowboard rails behind the jumps.

 Went to see the [Flint Festival Chorus](http://www.thefim.com/flint_festival_chorus.html) tonight which includes [Cameron](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=Jayouser), [Boulden](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=DzetaMostly), and [JRod](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=somewhereontheplanet). They did an amazing job. It was at the [First Presbyterian Church of Flint](http://www.fpcf.org/) which has a nice catherdal-y building. A glorious evening of high culture and refreshments.
 How can one life be so varied?
