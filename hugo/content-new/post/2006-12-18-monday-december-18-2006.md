I spent most of the day driving back and forth across town shopping. Not exactly the most fun, but I managed to buy a lot of neat gifts. So I only have to get a few more now.
As Faas and I say, "This year everyone on our list gets a fruitcake. No sharing!"
Speaking of Faas, I got our Christmas Letter today.
