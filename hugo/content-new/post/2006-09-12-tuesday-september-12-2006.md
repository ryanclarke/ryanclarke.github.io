I'm a patriot. I voted. I have the sticker to prove it. I have now voted from three states, if you count the absentee ballot I sent back to Georgia from Michigan.
I voted for Jake Flake.
I made Faas come down to the Best Western early with me and vote for Jake "the" Flake also. He was about to kill me when he found out it was only a primary. "Hey, it's your civic duty!" "But I wanted to sleep. I gave up a good dream for this. And a quiet morning in my own home."
Did you know that a passport is not valid as a voter ID? It's funny that the entire world excepts US passports on face value except the country that issued it.
Quote of the dawn-cracking morning. Faas: "Well Ryan, I laid down my life for my country today." Hey Faas, you're a patriot too. Nice sticker.
Ryan
