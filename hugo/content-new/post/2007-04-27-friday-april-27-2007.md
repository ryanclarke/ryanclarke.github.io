I've felt tired all day.
At work we have red film covering all the lights in the lab area (were I mostly work) in preparation for a light-sensitive product we're running next week. I've been in low light so much today (and red, no less, with my color-blindness!) that it's been almost like night. Try pulling a red-eye during the day, it's weird. So I think I have a pretty tiring week ahead, just from the environmental factors. It's kind of funny actually.
But first, I have a weekend scheduled.
Ryan
