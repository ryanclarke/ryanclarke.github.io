At the end of 2004 I said that it was the most important year of my life. Now at the end of 2005, I will have to modify that to second place.
 2005 has been the best year yet because of the places I went, the experiences I had, the people I knew, and the things I learned.
 The places I went:
 \~ Pinghu, China - in January through February for 4 weeks
 \~ IBLP Headquarters in Hinsdale, Illinois - in March, June, and September through November for a total of 10 weeks
 \~ Emporia, Kansas - in April for a week
 \~ Holland, Michigan - in May and August for a day each
 \~ Jamestown, Rhode Island and Guilford, Connecticut - in July for a week and a half for family reunions
 \~ Niles, Michigan and Goshen, Indiana - for a weekend for a wedding and overnight at Arlan's house
 \~ Marion, Ohio - in November for a weekend
 \~ Parrish, Florida - in December for a weekend
 The experiences I had:
 \~ Threw up for the first week straight
 \~ Taught English in a foreign country, experienced a different culture, and had a full-scale adventure
 \~ Turned 20
 \~ Went on a cattle drive
 \~ Attended an opera and numerous other concerts
 \~ Composed my Symphony No. 2 in F Major and conducted the premiere with the Verity Chamber Orchestra
 \~ Graduated from Verity
 \~ Visited Chicago several times
 \~ Jumped into Narragansett Bay with my cellphone
 \~ Tutored Harmony
 \~ Became a FedEx shipping expert
 \~ Took music theory classes with Dr. Kincaid
 \~ Created a website with hand-coded HTML: [www.ryanclarke.net](http://www.ryanclarke.net)
 \~ Visited (and scaled) the Warren G. Harding Memorial
 \~ Wore a fake bowtie at the Verity Christmas Banquet
 \~ Drove to south Florida and back with my good friend Bryce
 \~ Experienced some honest Christmas awe
 The people I knew:
 \~ My dear family
 \~ The super Verity '05 class
 \~ Also the Verity '06 class
 \~ The Chinese people, the students, and the teaching assistants, especially Steven, Rachel, and Leo
 \~ The good people at IBLP HQ, especially those in 4008 Adams, John Long and the Carlisle brothers, and also Matt Henton, Willie Antonion, and Mrs. Stern
 \~ The relatives I didn't know I had
 \~ The new Verity '07 class
 \~ The Verity Music students
 \~ The close friends God has given to me to strengthen me and help me grow to be like Him, a very short list: my man JRod, and of course Bryce Reckner, Cameron Houser, Josh Strickler, Callie and Sandy Bushatz, Sarah Ness, Teresa Tures, John Apple, Paul Jordan, Laura Cribb, Emily White, and don't forget Micah King
 The things I learned:
 \~ China is a really neat place
 \~ That people have emotions: I entered 2005 as a brain in a body, and left it with a heart, maybe small, but at least it's there; this caused me to rethink my entire philosophy of life and how I relate to people, because the logical answer might hurt their feelings
 \~ That God is bigger than I though
 \~ That the best place I can be is in God's will
 \~ That trusting God is super hard, but it's worth it, God will pull through everytime, I can trust God with my entire life
 \~ Desires and dreams are a good thing if we hold them with an open hand, but that's the trouble
 \~ The best way to grow up, is to become the closest to God that you can
 \~ The 'more' mature you become, the less mature you see that you are
 \~ The list is much to long to fully list (or even remember) right here
 God has been bountifully good to me this year. I am not big into New Year's Resolutions, I try to avoid tying myself to anything that I might break inadvertently, so instead I will set a few goals for the year.
 Goals for 2006:
 \~ I want to give my entire life God, for what every He wants to do through me
 \~ I want to exercise so that when I'm 50 I can still rearrange the sofas in my living room
 \~ I want to figure out what specific work(s) God want's me to accomplish with my life
 I thank the Lord for giving me such a wonderful year, and I thank all of you that have had a part in it. Let's enter 2006 with the Lord's help and make it even better!
