Well, it's a little slower around here now. Everyone of importance is out taking pictures. Or rather, having pictures of themselves taken.
I am thoroughly enjoying having a blast here. I'm staying with the Stricklers and it is definitely the place to be. The whole family is fun and energetic. Yesterday and this morning we spent a lot of time getting the Strickler's "backyard" ready for the reception. It's in the 'grove' next to the pond. I put grove within marks because it's unlike a normal grove. Their grandfather loved trees so he planted over 300 different types of trees around the farm (some of which has since been sold off to make a highway). The grove has about 30 huge trees of several varieties including a redwood and the back side of the pond has about 40 more types. The evergreen windbreak in front of the house is equally varied. It's actually a really neat look. So the reception is ready. Also, Josh and I got his new radio wired into his car. So it looks like everything is in order for the wedding this evening at the church and then the reception afterward.
I wish more of you Verity friends of Josh could have come, you'd be having a blast too.
