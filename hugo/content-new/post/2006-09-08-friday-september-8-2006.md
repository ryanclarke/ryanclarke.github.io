I want to be able to give a little bit of happiness into someone's life. To be a positive point as I pass the proverbial public's path. To be always ready with a wise response and an uplifting word. Like when the two guys stopped my in the Wal\*Mart parking lot earlier this evening and asked me my explanation for why interpersonal contact is so important. On camera. All these people we meet every day. We have 30 seconds before we'll never see them again. What should I do with that half minute? Sometimes I wish I knew as I stare at the floor and let them silently ring up my twin-size sheets, and order my Chedder Burger with the large fries, and scan out Excel 2003 for Dummies. Eternal impact is wasted. What would a 30 second testimony be like?
But sometimes, I like to get a little bit of happiness back. Sometimes I get so focused on one lack-of-happiness that I forget the many blessings I so regularly enjoy. How rut-minded: I get so focused following the scratchy spiral groove around and round endlessly that I forget to hear the music. God is smiling on me, let me not forget.
Just a little bit of happiness. 30 seconds worth. Apply liberally. You'll find it coming back.
