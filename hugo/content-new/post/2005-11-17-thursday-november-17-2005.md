Finally, I am all packed. And the pile of boxes, like presents to myself of stuff I already own, are in the FedEx system enroute to my house. 230lbs (\$132.80 American) worth of enroute boxes.
 I leave the RCI tomorrow morning at 8:30am. JRod, the guy who I've spent so many hours each day with over the last 20 months, I will not see again for a long time. So 8:30am tomorrow will be sad.
 And soon I'll be home!
