Today was not what you would really call a good day.
 Sarah Ness left after only two short days here. I found out that my Symphony No. 2 is not going to be performed next week, it is pushed back to January. A plan that I had fell through. I felt tired all day. I have a project hanging over my head. I forgot about park night and came down to late to get a van.
 Nope, today couldn't really be called a good day.
 But I got two goals in soccer, a gift for someone, and an encouraging thank-you note. Yes, there is joy in doing, joy in giving, and joy in being appreciated. These little blessings allowed me to keep a smile on today.
 It might not be a good day by most standards, but, I guess, looking back, to me, it was a good day. Because even the 'bad' things had good in them.
 Sarah Ness left after only two short days here *(but she came, and I got to see her!)*. I found out that my Symphony No. 2 is not going to be performed next week, it is pushed back to January *(but a real symphony is going to play my music!)*. A plan that I had fell through *(but it was not going to work out that great anyway!)*. I felt tired all day *(but I got a good nap!)*. I have a project hanging over my head *(but it is a very interesting project!*). I forgot about park night and came down to late to get a van *(but fortunately Garret came by on the way to the park from an errand and picked me up!)*.
 Today was a good day.
