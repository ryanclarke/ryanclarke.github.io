Regarding the poem from two days ago.
I'm not really good at listening to people. Except myself, and even then my attention wanders, as other listeners can probably tell. I am improving in my listening skills, so praise God for that, but I have so much unconscious selfishness in my system that the Lord is really trying to get me to notice other people.
"But Lord, I try to listen now."
"But Ryan, can you care for people by noticing them."
Do I even see when they are hurting and try to help? Do I get shivers in my spine when someone is excited? Does the realness of another person's life matter to me? Or are they just facts?
I was thinking about all this and I remembered a tough episode about 2 years ago when God really showed me the inside of other people's souls by exposing my own. That was when I wrote the poem.
And now I'm just doing some "sanctification for dear life." God's really had me on a growth routine this last year.
Ryan
