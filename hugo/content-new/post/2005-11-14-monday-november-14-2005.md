I'm leaving.
 Winter break is finally here. My goal is to bring every last posession when I go back home this week. I can easily bring up the clothes and books I need when I came back to teach. I have a lot of stuff here. More than I thought. It will not all fit on the airplane, so I have started two projects: collecting big enough boxes and filling those boxes with posessions.
