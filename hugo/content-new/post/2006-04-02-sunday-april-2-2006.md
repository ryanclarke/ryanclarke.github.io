I went to Third Avenue church today. Very small and friendly, but they have a huge ministry. Real Christianity.
I played Settlers of Catan for the first time today. I was doing pretty well until I ran headfirst into a rule I didn't know about. After that I wasn't able to do anything. Also, it doesn't really pay to be very nice when you're trading: do what's best for you if you want to do well. It's a fun game though, and I hope to do better next time. Anyone up for a game some night this week?
