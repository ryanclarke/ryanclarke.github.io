The Hinsdale-ians have a nice library. It is not nearly as large as Flint's though. So it's nice, but on the small side.
 While we were in Hinsdale we dropped into GAP Women. I guess it's a pretty nice clothing store. I tell you what, fashions these days! Those girls aren't getting much clothing for their money. So many of the various articles are rather miserly in their use of fabric. It's pretty sad.
 It was a really hot day. At least, on my scale. So the Baskin Robbins ice cream really hit the spot. And the treat was curtesy of Minna. It's been fun here. The three of us are having a grand old time.
