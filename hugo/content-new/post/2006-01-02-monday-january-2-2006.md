The Wilds is great!
 We have internet here, which is really good because I'll be needing to do some TESC portfolios stuff this week.
 I hung out with Sarah and David today! It's great seeing them each again. And I'm rooming with Boulden and Samaha. It's going to be a fun room... Yeehaw! I'm liking this: good friends, good teaching, good food, good fun.
