I am now twenty-one years old.
I am now a full-legal man.
I must be ready to be a man. I can no longer wait for life to start: it has already started. What I do now affects my future. I must be mature.
I am deeply grateful to all those who have been responsible for my reaching this age in my present, fairly good, condition. Especially my parents: nothing can say how good they were in raising me right. Also many of those mentioned in my New Year's post have been immeasurably used of God to grow me closer to Him.
There is an exciting, solemn duty to being old, may I wear it with honor and wisdom. And may I gain favor with God and man. Especially God.
Ryan
