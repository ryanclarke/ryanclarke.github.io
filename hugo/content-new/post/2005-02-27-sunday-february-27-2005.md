There was a wedding here at the RCI today. Apparently a lot of the girls here watched it. I hear the reason girls go to weddings is to see the bride's dress. I think that is a dumb reason to go to a wedding. I guess some guys went to watch it also. Do guys go to weddings just to see the bride's dress? Anyway, if you think about it, a wedding is an almost impossible thing. Yet it is so common!
"A wedding is a ceremony at which two persons undertake to become one."  \~ Ambrose Bierce
 I wrote a Meditation Commentary on loving my enemies.
 "Friends may come and go, but enemies accumulate." \~ Thomas Jones
"The best way to destroy an enemy is to make him a friend."  \~ Abraham Lincoln
 Tried to fix Ben Andrews computer, so did Apple and Paul, and it's still having problems.

 Some thoughts and questions: Rejoicing in all things is one Bible command, which when I attempt to obey, I feel like a hypocrite. Am I alone in this feeling? Also, is frowning when I'm happy hypocritical? Is it wrong? If I'm happy do I have to smile? What do you think?
