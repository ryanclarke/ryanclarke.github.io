Today Faas and I was to the Tonto Natural Bridge. It's the world's largest travertine bridge. And it's only 10 miles away. The \$3 per adult entrance fee was well repaid. Just look at these pictures.
We hiked down into the Pine Creek Canyon about a half mile upstream of the bridge.

We saw a beautiful stream of waterfalls along one edge of the canyon.

We walked very slowly soaking in the sights. However, when we saw the bridge it topped everything we saw before. This is me standing in the upstream opening of the bridge.

The bridge is 150 feet wide inside. You can get a feel for the size in this picture of Faas.

Here is a view looking out the downstream end of the 400 foot-long bridge.

On the downstream opening there is a little ribbon of water that falls the 183 foot tall arch.

On the way back to the car we stopped at an overlook to see the big picture.

Though the whole hike was only about a mile, we took 2 hours because of all the incredible sights. A truly amazing place. If any of you are in the area, stop by and we'll take you to see God's Arc de Triomphe. Only God could make something like that.
