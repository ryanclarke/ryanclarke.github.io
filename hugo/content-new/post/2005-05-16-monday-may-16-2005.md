What a happy day! I conducted yet another rehearsal of my second symphony. How fun. I think my conducting is improving. You'd think it would be easy to wave a stick around, but judging from how many times I mess up and turn my piece into a jumble of dissonance, it's not easy. It is non-verbal communication that 20 people have to understand simultaneously.
 Ice cream is good. Especially in large quantities. I filled out my five and got my ice cream tonight. That was a really good idea from Mama Shoe. I hope we have many people come to Verity because of it.
