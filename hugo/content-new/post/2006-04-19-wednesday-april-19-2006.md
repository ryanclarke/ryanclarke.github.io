I'm going to visit JRod tomorrow!
Monterrey, Mexico look out, here I come! And so Ryan will visit his third country: USA, China, and now Mexico. I'm pretty excited.
Today was a full day. I've basically finished my degree. My parents are going to send out the evidence for my last portfolio within the next 2 days, and then I'll be done with everything except applying for graduation, which I'll do in a few weeks, once I have all 122 credits all at the same place (TESC) at the same time (before May 25th, I hope!).
Life is going fast. Sometimes to fast. In other words, I was busy. But things should calm down for a fun, relaxing week tomorrow.
Wish me well! I'll try to update, with pictures.
Ryan
