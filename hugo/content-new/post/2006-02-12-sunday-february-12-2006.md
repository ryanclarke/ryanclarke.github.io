This has been a very pleasant and restful weekend. Many good things. I practiced with my volleyball team on Saturday and can only say, "Watch out!" The meal Cornerstone Baptist gave us after the sermon was very good. Having time on the weekend to talk with good friends is always enjoyable.
And now I am ready to dive back into the harmony instruction!
