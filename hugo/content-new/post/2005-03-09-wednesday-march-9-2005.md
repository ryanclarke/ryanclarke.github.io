I played pingpong today. And a lot of piano. I had my first game in the pingpong tournament and I was beaten twice by Jonathan Boulden. So now I'm officially in the loser's bracket. I hope to win one match.
 I went to the going away party for Abi Massey. It was nice. And they had ice cream cake and soda. Quite a party. You know, Kendra is just a really neat person. I can't believe I never talked to her before China.
 Béla Bartók was a a great Hungarian composer who lived from 1881 to 1945. His pieces are very good, but often quite wierd and modern sounding. His rhythms and dissonances are very interesting. He was heavily influenced by ethnic Hungarian music. Famous piece include *Mikrokosmos*, *Kossuth*, and *Concerto for Orchestra*.
