Mozart's music is perfect.
Sometimes is seems like it's performed too perfectly. Like a sanitary little capsule that has no connection with life. Sometimes it feels like it needs an injection of some little passion and tension in order to bond with our souls. Like Beethoven or Mendelssohn, or Dvorak or Elgar. It's interesting that we can only find passing cerebral interest in sterile music like Clementi, but music with some trouble, like Beethoven, easily finds a deep acceptance by diverse cultures across two centuries.
We humans are so flawed and sinful that we can't relate to perfection. I feel at a loss to describe how Jesus lived among us and felt our lives and yet had nothing wrong in Him. It's unfathomable. I was trying to briefly sum up the amazing glory of heaven to an unbeliever today and almost immediately was at a loss for words. "What will it be like?" We have no way to comprehend perfection. Even our idea of 'good' is tainted by wrong motives. The concept of perfection is completely foreign. But gorgeous.
And so Mozart is telling me tonight that I am sinful but God is perfect: strive ever upward.
