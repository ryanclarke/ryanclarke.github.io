I had the great opportunity to go spend the night at Bullinger's house. It was a very fun time.
Tomorrow morning at 9am the '07 music folks, my students, take their Principles of Harmony 1 final test. This will be my first class to take the test, so I'm a little nervous even though I know they are going to do well. Basically, my job is over: now only prayer remains. I, at least, will be praying for them during the 3-hour ordeal.
