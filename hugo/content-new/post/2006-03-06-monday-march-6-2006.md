The test this morning went well. And now I am currently in a process to get them graded. I've been trying to get them sent to Dr. Kincaid to be graded for over 9 hours. It's a total mess.
My volleyball team won one match and lost another, making us not longer undefeated. I'm really happy abut how well our team is doing.
