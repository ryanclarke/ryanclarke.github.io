"Love is the condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own." I saw this quote in the 3rd floor classroom. And I sort of agree with it. But I thought, wouldn't it be neat if all people were like that to each other? Maybe not to that extent, but what if people really cared about each other. What if hard timesÂ  make other people sad with the sufferer? And then I thought, "What if everyone is already like that, and I'm the only one uncaring." So I'm going to try and be more caring, less ridgid and factual. We'll see how it goes.
 I took this personality test today. OK, it was more like I got a personality test *administered* to me. I almost failed. But that is not my fault. Because this was a trick test, a very deceptive test. A test that weasled false information out of me without my knowledge. So yes, if I try to administer a personality test to you in the near future, be aware of devious results.
