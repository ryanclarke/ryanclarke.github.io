I'm home!!!
 It's great to be back where I belong. Or at least, to be back among family. The Wilds Music Conference was very good, I would love to go back. The trip home with the Bill's was easy and uneventful. I made it back to Atlanta by 2:30 where I was picked up and then did errands with Mom.
 Life continues, and the good times leave us fun memories.
