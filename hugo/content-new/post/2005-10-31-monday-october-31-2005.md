On Halloween, Chipotle (the restaurant) give out free burritos to anyone wearing tinfoil. So we all got dressed up in tinfoil and went. Sure enough, they made them for free. A lot of HQ people showed up for it. One group of guys went so far as to dress up completely in Star Wars Tinfoil complete with a tinfoil mummy which they carried in and out. Of course, being mostly members of the video department, they capture the whole thing on film, so if you see it at a conference one year... I just made some tinfoil cuffs, and JRod went as a tinfoil comedy show host. This is the closest I've ever come to "trick or treat"ing. And I got a burrito.
 Also, school is going well.
