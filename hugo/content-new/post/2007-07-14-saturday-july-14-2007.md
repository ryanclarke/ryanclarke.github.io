To do:
Sat. 8-Noon: fund raiser car wash with the church youth.
Sat. 5-Midnight: trip to Chandler to hear an Answers in Genesis speaker
Sun. 7:30-11:30am: Church
Sun. 6-7pm: Evangelism Explosion training
Mon. 7am: Fly to Vancouver, BC to work 15+ hour days
Just when things were beginning to calm down, they are as crazy as ever again. Wait, they were beginning to calm down? Since when? At least I'm doing what I enjoy.
