I recently discovered a new type of humor thanks to Wikipedia: the Tom Swifty. Enjoy.
"I manufacture tabletops," said Tom counterproductively.
"I used to be a military test pilot," Tom explained.
"I'm afraid I flunked my electrocardiogram," said Tom half-heartedly.
"I can't remember what I was supposed to buy," said Tom listlessly.
"What would I need a prop gun for?" asked Tom blankly.
"I dropped the toothpaste," said Tom, crestfallen.
"I'll never stick my arm in the lion's mouth again," Tom said offhandedly.
"I'm wearing my wedding ring," Tom said with abandon.
"I just love camping!" Tom said intently.
"--. --- --- -.. -... -.-- .," Tom said remorsefully.
"I came, I saw," Tom concurred.
"I fall ill every Tuesday," said Tom weakly.
"That's the woman!" Tom said dismissively.
"What was it like, commanding the Confederate troops?" Tom asked generally.
"Must I sing at church this week?" Tom inquired.
