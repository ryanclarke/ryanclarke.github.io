My second weekend filling in for Pastor Allen with the youth is over. I have really enjoyed the opportunity to share more powerfully with the kids, but it's tiring. God really blessed me and helped me. Last night at youth group I taught about anger and the good and bad kinds and how to correctly deal with it. This morning in Sunday School I taught the final lesson in a series called Totally Consumed about being an authentic worshiper. It was the lesson on revival and how revivals start with prayer and repentance in the lives of believers. "Revival starts with me." Only as we show the world what a true believer looks like can they be attracted by our ambassadorship to Christ.
Another week of work comes ahead and then the youth trip to Magic Mountain to ride some roller coasters and listen to some good Christian youth speakers.
