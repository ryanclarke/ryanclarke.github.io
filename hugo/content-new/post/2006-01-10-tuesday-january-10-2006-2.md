You all are making me feel like a miserable whiner. Complaining about a little illness. Well, today's the happy day.
 No fever anymore! I took a shower, got my hair cut, and I'm moving on with life. I still have a pretty sore throat, but that will improve with time.
 I received the exciting news today! I am too happy. I'll tell you all about it later. God is good!
