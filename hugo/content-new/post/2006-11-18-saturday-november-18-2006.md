Last night I watched [Sophie Scholl - The Final Days](http://www.zeitgeistfilms.com/scholl_html/flash.html). Faas found it and it's a winner. I highly recommend it. Be sure to read the "About the film" page.
Sophie Scholl was one of the founding members of the White Rose student anti-Nazi group in Munich. As a Christian who saw through the propaganda and lies of Hitler, she boldly stood with her brother Hans and some friends as they distributed anti-Nazi leaflets throughout Munich and the rest of Germany. They fought for freedom regardless of it's personal cost. The movie is a very powerful film on freedom and personal responsibility. Surely not a feel-good film, you will be challenged and inspired by the courage of the White Rose's heroine.
Other than the understandably tense and psychologically brutal setting in the Third Reich, there is no perverse content in the film. It's entirely in German (including credits), with English subtitles.
Haha, JRod's passion for movies must have worn off: I'm not above putting in a plug for a good one now. Thanks JRod.
