So I went to the Spirit of Christmas concert tonight. The sound may be described as "[Trans-Siberian Orchestra](http://wm.wmg.com/epromo/site-label/lava-label/xmasevesarajevo-wma-full.wma)." In fact, they played the TSO's pieces. There was also was a choir that was microphoned so badly that they sounded awful when they really weren't. So it was enjoyable, although different than I expected.
