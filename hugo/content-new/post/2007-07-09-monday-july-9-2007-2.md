Byron moved in last night. And so begins another adventure. He's a neat guy, I think I'm going to like him.
And he brought a HUGE TV, and XBOX 360, and a Wii. So my little Vicarage has now been fully-entertainment-center-ized.
But I'm too busy "The New Evidence That Demands A Verdict" by Josh McDowell. A very good book.
Is anyone flying into Philadelphia on Friday, August 10th for Josh Strickler's Wedding? I'm looking to rent a car to drive over to Elizabethtown. I'd be leaving out Sunday afternoon. Let me know if you're interested.
Ryan
