I love symphony concerts! The piece I went to hear, Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, was simply incredible. Wow, and I love Ravel's orchestration of it. At the intermission I turned to my companions and said, "This is the life."
Today has been enjoyable, and tomorrow starts the last week of the first half of the harmony class. At the end: a test. A test for my students of how well they've learned, but also of me, of how well I've taught. I hope I pass the test.
