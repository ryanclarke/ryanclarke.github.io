I had zucchini pie today. It was really good, to my great surprise. Thanks Jenell.
 I was thinking about the courtship/dating thing today, and I had a new thought. I realized the Biblical model is to go to sleep and see who's there when you wake up.
 Anyway, I think I'm going to go to bed now. And I should probably unlock the door.
