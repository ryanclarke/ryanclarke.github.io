I wrote three minutes of orchestral music today. It only took about 6 hours. That is a pretty good ratio. I'm really happy. I'm also really happy with how it turned out and with how it sounded when the Verity Chamber Orchestra sight-read it tonight. So the third movement of my second symphony is finaly written. Only one more movement to go!
 Composing really takes the energy out of me. It is hard work. I had a great night sleep, a refreshing devotion, an exciting day, and now I'm exhausted.
