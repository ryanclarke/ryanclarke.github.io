Today is International Talk Like A Pirate Day. While I'm not talking like a pirate, I would like to dedicate this post to the pirates of yore and the work they did preventing global warming. In fact, if you look at this chart I found on Wikipedia, you see the direct statistical relationship between the decline of the swashbuckling pirate population and increased global warming.

They kept the world a pleasant place. I fear there is nothing we can do anymore.
