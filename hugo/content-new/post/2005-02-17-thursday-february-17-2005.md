So I turn 20 years old today. I’ve had a great time and matured a lot since then (I guess meaning when I was born). I’ve also learned a lot. So now I’m 20. I even got to say that I was 20 on an official document today: it was for the Verity ski trip. Oh well, I felt special writing "20” in the blank marked "age:\_20\_”. That form asked me for a lot of personal information, height, weight, shoe size. "eye color:\_pink\_” Ok, they didn’t ask me for eye color, but it is pink. I have some sort of illness that is pretty weird. Blake and I call it the "Yangtze River Virus” because that makes it sound scary. Anyway, at least Callie says that it makes my red shirts complement my eyes, whatever that means. My eyes feel complemented. Speaking of complements, I couldn’t believe so many people wanted to say nice stuff about me in chapel when I was standing up front after "Happy Birthday.” This Ryan guy that everyone was talking about seemed like such a nice guy it was hard to remember that they were talking about me. Anyway, I was touched. Anyway, it has been a great birthday so far. I only wish I could see my family….

As Fran Lebowitz (whoever they were) said, "Life is something that happens when you can't get to sleep.”
