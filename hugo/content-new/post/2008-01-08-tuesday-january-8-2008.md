Using [http://www.online-stopwatch.com/large-stopwatch/](http://www.online-stopwatch.com/large-stopwatch/%20), I read the Hardy Boys book The Tower Treasure in 1 hour and 11 minutes and 1 second. That is shorter than the movie would be. This beats my previous (and first) record of 1 hour and 45 minutes, roughly.
