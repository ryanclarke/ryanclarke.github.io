Some days it just feels like I'm dumping whole segments of my life down a laundry chute to be run through the wringer and hung out to dry. I mean, I do my time, earn my paycheck, but still, I want to be able to do something for the company. I want to do more than serve my hours and cash my check, I want to help PCS move forward and succeed and grow.
Somehow, spending 9 hours proving that olive waste liquid at a pH of 4.16 will stick pungent powder all over the entire inside of the drying chamber, piping, cyclone, and remaining piping isn't my idea of progress. But then again, progress isn't always glamorous. Sometimes it's just proving that Idea A was a really bad idea.
Tomorrow I hope to prove that Idea B is a good idea. Maybe we can make a fine olive waste powder. Or at least, as 'fine' as that stuff can be. That would be my idea of progress.
By the way, I wish xanga had a "scratch 'n' sniff" option. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a good whiff... would be better off skipped.
On a personal note, my face is falling off in little pieces. Yesterday I was red enough to open a casino, today I'm so peelish and splotchy that I look like a bad case of lint. Tomorrow, who knows. Maybe I'll feel normal enough to shave again. I'm losing my "California mask." Tip to buyers: beware the spray-on sunscreen if you want an effective product.
