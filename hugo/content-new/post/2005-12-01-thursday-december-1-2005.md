More music history study. I really like music history, but this course is very heavy and time consuming. But it's good. I've met a bunch of guys with neat names. Such as "Johannes Ockeghem." Caution: you must have a hairball in your throat to say it correctly. And get this, there was actually a style called musica ficta (lit. 'feigned music'). Basically it's what they called sharps and flat because they didn't think of them as real notes. Odd.
 But I survive.
